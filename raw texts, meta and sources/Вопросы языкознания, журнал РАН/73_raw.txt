Is contact-induced syncretism possible?
A corpus-based study on bilingual verbal morphology 
of spoken German in Russian Siberia

Abstract: This paper investigates bilingual verbs in a corpus of spoken German by L1 speakers in Rus-
sian Siberia. The study analyzes bilingual verb formations of the type hinpostupaje, which are inserted 
into a position corresponding to a native verb. Different kinds of inﬂ ectional and word-formation pat-
terns in bilingual verbs are identiﬁ ed and discussed with reference to the contact-induced morphology 
of German and Russian. The study demonstrates that the bilingual verbs follow morphophonemic reg-
ularities, and that there are several traces of morphophonemic syncretism. It argues that the bilingual 
speakers make use of German and Russian morphology in an innovative way, which cannot be ex-
plained by classical morphology alone. The bilingual formatives identiﬁ ed differ from the form/func-
tion equivalents in both German and Russian morphology. Further research should therefore include 
cognitive aspects of bilingual morphology.

Аннотация: В статье исследуются «двуязычные» глаголы в корпусе разговорной речи носителей 
немецкого языка, проживающих в Сибири. Анализируются немецко-русские образования типа 
hinpostupaje, функционирующие как глаголы. Выделяются различные модели словоизменения 
и словообразования «двуязычных» глаголов; они обсуждаются в свете контактной морфологии 
немецкого и русского языков. Исследование показывает, что «двуязычные» глаголы подчиня-
ются морфонологическим закономерностям и обнаруживат некоторые следы морфонологиче-
ского синкретизма. Делается вывод о том, что билингвы используют русский и немецкий мор-
фологический материал инновационными способами, для объяснения которых недостаточно 
классических методов морфологии. Рассматриваемые «двуязычные» образования отличаются 
от своих формальных и функциональных эквивалентов в русском и немецком. В связи с этим, 
дальнейшие исследования должны учитывать когнитивные аспекты двуязычной морфологии.

1. Goal of the investigation and research questions
Morphosyntactic structures from Russian have consistently affected the German varieties spo-
ken in Russia over a period of more than 200 years.1 Syntactic phenomena such as verb-ﬁ rst or-
der in declarative sentences and pro-drop of subject pronouns, which often coincide with mor-
phological borrowings, have recently been the subject of more detailed investigations [Andersen 
2016a; 2016b]. But contrastive studies focusing on structural and/or typological phenomena are 
still rare, which is all the more concerning considering that the time for fruitful applied research 
is running out: “[…] the onset of the 21st century bears witness to the last potential (semi-)func-
tional speakers of many of these dialect communities, it would seem that the time to conduct 
meaningful research on these dialects is now” [Putnam (ed.) 2011: 1].2
Based on the previous investigations, the goal of this study is to investigate bilingual verb 
units that have hitherto not been included in typologies of German and Russian, although this 
phenomenon of bilingual speech is well-known in contact linguistics. Muysken investigated 
bilingual verbs in typologically different languages and noted that code-mixing in verbal sys-
tems is often innovative, “leading to structures not present in either of the languages in contact” 
[Muysken 2000: 184]. This is particularly noticeable in Colonial German from Russian Siberia. 
Consider the following example 3:
(1) 
Jets    henze      uns   kants   naies    eivodide 4
���    ���.3��    ���    ���     ���       ���
jetzt    haben-sie   uns    ganz    Neues    eingeführt
‘Now they have introduced something very new.’
In (1), the verb perfect unit (predicate) henze eivodide has in the position of the German per-
fect participle a bilingual verb containing the verb stem of the Russian inﬁ nitive vodit’ ‘lead’, 
the German verb formation preﬁ x ei-, and the German inﬁ nitive sufﬁ x -e. The bilingual verb 
eivodide is morphologically a German inﬁ nitive with a Russian stem. A wide range of several 
contact-linguistic and cognitive phenomena can activate the underlying triggers of such verb 
 
1 But it should be mentioned that code-mixing with Russian was stigmatized for a long time, see Dinges 
[1923: 60]: “[…] so geht und fragt die Russen und hört wie sie urteilen. Sie lachen sich aus über die 
Deutschen, die auf Schritt und Tritt russische Wörter in ihre Sprache hineinﬂ icken und sie noch dabei 
schlecht aussprechen […].”
 
2 An exception is the volume “Studies on German-language islands” [Putnam (ed.) 2011] introducing 
generative and structural studies on German-language islands in Northern America (Wisconsin, Texas, 
Pennsylvania), Italy (Cimbrian German) and the Netherlands (Plautdietsch). Unfortunately, studies 
on German-language islands in Russia are missing.
 
3 This example is taken from the transcription of a dialogue between a grandmother and grandchild liv-
ing in the Russian Altai region [Moskaljuk 2013].
 
4 This and the following examples from the Siberian German Corpus (see more details in section 2) are in ital-
ics, the Russian insertions are in bold. The linguistic description is given as follows: morphosyntactic fea-
tures for relevant word forms, Standard German lexemes, and English translation of the corpus example.

formations. Muysken subsumes these complex phenomena under the term “congruent lexical-
ization”, when “the grammatical structure is shared by languages A and B, and words from both 
languages a and b are inserted more or less randomly” [Muysken 2000: 8]. But what does “more 
or less randomly” mean for morphological units like eivodide and what makes it different from 
Russian and German morphology? In cognitive approaches to morphology, particularly in con-
nectionist models, morphemes are not represented as discrete entities. “Instead, as the network 
learns to map from one domain to another (e.g. sound to meaning) it picks up on regularities 
in the mappings. Morphology arises as a consequence of the correlations between codes” [Sei-
denberg, Gonnerman 2000: 356]. It is useful to bear the connectionist view in mind when inves-
tigating odd contact-induced morphological verb formations like eivodide.
While we concentrate on contact-induced phenomena, we will argue in particular that there 
are speciﬁ c restrictions for certain language pairs in different bilingual speech situations, i.e. “not 
anything structural” is possible in contact speech [Myers-Scotton 2002: ix], and that language 
contact phenomena are constrained by the requirements of the given grammar of the contact-in-
duced speech [Andersen 2016b: 8]. A further approach adopted in the following investigation 
is the notion of contact-induced syncretism, arising probably in the morphological phenomena 
in the investigated corpus. We understand simple syncretism as cases in which “two or more 
cells with different values for a feature are merged” [Baerman et al. 2005: 13].
Based on these considerations, the investigation will concentrate on the following questions:
(i) 
What kind of inﬂ ectional and/or word-formation morphemes are inserted into the bilin-
gual verb units under investigation?
(ii) Can particular word-formation patterns be identiﬁ ed in the bilingual verb units under 
investigation?
(iii) To what extent does the language pair and/or the direction of language transfer matter 
in this speciﬁ c case of contact-induced morphology?
The background and special conditions of the corpus and several types of investigated data 
are presented in section 2. Relevant typological contrasts between German and Russian taking 
into account the grammatical structure of the German varieties in Russia are discussed in sec-
tion 3. There follows an analysis of two types of verb formation contained in the material in sec-
tion 4: (1) inserted Russian verb forms and (2) Russian verb stems with German afﬁ xes. The 
analysis seeks to answer research question (i). The particular word-formation patterns are then 
discussed in section 5 with reference to research question (ii): Finally, in section 6 an attempt is 
made to answer research question (iii).
2. Research corpus and types of data
The corpus data for this study are taken from the digitalized Siberian German Corpus (SGC) 5 
at the University of Gothenburg.6 It has been speciﬁ cally created as a sample of the German 
 
5 The corpus data consist of audio recordings from the Krasnoyarsk region between 1988 and 1998, col-
lected by Valentina Djatlova (V. P. Astafyev Russian State Pedagogical University in the city of Kras-
noyarsk) and video recordings from the Krasnoyarsk region of 2010 collected by the author with the 
help of Russian colleagues at the Astafyev University. The transcription and annotation of the two lin-
guistic corpora was a part of the research project “Syntax in Contact. Word Order in a Variety of Ger-
man Spoken in East Siberia” at the University of Gothenburg in collaboration with the Astafyev Uni-
versity between 2008 and 2016. The transcription follows the broad outlines of the transcription sys-
tem of Spoken German GAT [Selting et al. 1998].

language which has been spoken in Russia for two hundred years by ethnic Germans who immi-
grated to Russia as colonists. The speakers 7 are between 70 and 80 years old, and are probably 
the last generation speaking German as their heritage language [Andersen 2016c].
The SGC consists of transcriptions of spoken narratives and dialogues of the German variety 
spoken by about 36,000 people in the Siberian region of Krasnoyarsk (Russia). The SGC con-
tains a total of 50,413 tokens, see the interface of the SGC in the ﬁ gure below:
Figure. The interface of the SGC showing examples of the token war ‘was’
The SGC is partly annotated: Russian words and German-Russian bilingual word units are 
given in square brackets; verb units have the attribute ����� (ﬁ nite verb) or ������� (perfect par-
ticiple or inﬁ nitive). A quantitative breakdown of the data in the SGC is as follows:

50,413 (100 %)

2,152 (4.3 %)
1,503 (3 %)
About 3 % of the total number of tokens is borrowed from Russian. These borrowings in-
clude sequential code switches and different types of lexical borrowings. However, the propor-
tion of lexical borrowings is relatively low. Typical borrowings are nouns, adjectives, adverbs 
and various discourse markers as illustrated in (2):

In (2) the adverb družno, derived from the adjective družnyj, is used in the phrase die Leute 
leben einträchtig. The sample is a direct transfer of the Russian phrase žit’ družno ‘to live in har-
mony’, which can be translated into Standard German as in Eintracht leben. As we can see, the 
transfer of a lexical item mostly triggers further borrowing of lexical and structural constructions. 
Like the adverb družno, which appears only once in the SGC, most of the lexical borrowings are 
used spontaneously. Only Russian discourse markers are more integrated in the German speech. 
The Russian discourse marker nu ‘well’ appears most frequently in the SGC.8
High frequency of ﬁ nite auxiliaries is another typical property of the SGC, see table 1. 
As a German contact variety, German in Siberia is still a sample of spoken German. However, it 
cannot come as a surprise that the verbs are mostly used in the present and perfect tenses. Verb 
forms of the German past tense do not occur at all (exceptions are the auxiliaries war, hatte 
etc.). Another interesting quantitative result of the SGC is the absence of ﬁ nite bilingual verbs. 
In other words, the German ﬁ nite verbs are not linked with Russian morphemes in the sample 
under investigation. But about 1.5 % of the total number of borrowings in the corpus are non-
ﬁ nite bilingual verbs with a Russian stem and German afﬁ xes as in example (1) above. On the 
other hand, there is not a single case in the SGC where the nonﬁ nite verb consists of a German 
stem and Russian inﬂ ectional morphemes, which is certainly remarkable.
But studies which compare the speech of Russian and Russian-German immigrants in Ger-
many show opposite patterns. Russian immigrant speakers produce bilingual verbs in Russian 
speech with a German verb stem and Russian inﬂ ectional morphemes, as the following exam-
ples show: behandlevat’ (behandeln ‘treat’, Russian inﬁ nitive sufﬁ x -vat’ ), vermissevaem (ver-
missen ‘miss’, Russian inﬂ ectional sufﬁ x -vaem, 1��, ���) [Berend 2014: 232]. The same phe-
nomenon is documented in the speech of Russian immigrants in Sweden. The Russian immi-
grants use Swedish verb stems with Russian inﬁ nitive sufﬁ xes as in bukovat’ (boka ‘book’) and 
sjuklat’ (cykla ‘bike’) [Lisik 2013: 63].
The following section discusses the crucial typological differences between German and Rus-
sian morphosyntax.
3. Typological differences between German and Russian 
taking into account the morphosyntactic structure 
of spoken German in Siberia
In the spirit of Hawkins [1986], the contrastive approach will be applied as a comple-
ment of typological studies. Hawkins, who has suggested a contrastive typology of German 
and English, argued that it “adopts a methodology which is in many ways the exact inverse 
of the comparative-universal approach. Whereas this latter examines a small number of vari-
ant linguistic properties in a large number of languages, the present approach looks at a large 
number of variant linguistic properties in a small number of languages” [Ibid.: 3]. Moreover, 
the contrastive approach is motivated by the goal of this investigation. It is undeniable that 
the sample under investigation in the SGC is a German contact variety. Russian is present 
 
8 The discourse marker nun (34 tokens) is used less often than its Russian counterpart nu (59 tokens) in the 
SGC. Compared with other Russian borrowings, nu is used relatively frequently and it shows a higher 
heterogeneity concerning the word order type in the German contact variety. Most of the examples with 
nu surprisingly contain a verb-ﬁ rst order and not the typical German verb-second order [Andersen 2016a: 
280ff]. Russian discourse markers seem to be a crucial linguistic unit also in other typologically different 
languages spoken in Russia as in an Udmurt-Russian mixed code [Kaysina 2014], which shows similar 
phenomena to German in Siberia. But apart from that, it is not the subject of the present study.

throughout as an embedded language in the vocabulary as well as in the grammatical struc-
ture of this German variety.
Even though Russian and German are not closely related languages, as Indo-European lan-
guages, they both have verbal systems that function as the core of the sentence, determining 
syntactic and semantic role assignments. In addition, German and Russian verbs have inﬂ ec-
tion-bearing morphemes, marked for person, number and tense. That means code-mixing in the 
verbal system is to be expected but is unpredictable in detail. To begin with, let’s have a look 
at an example [Andersen 2016a: 273] from the SGC:
(3) 
hat       nich   gefunde    weg
���.3��   ���    ����       ���
hat        nicht   gefunden    Weg
‘He did not ﬁ nd the way.’
(3′) Ne    našël     put’
���   ���.��.�   ���
not    found      way
‘He didn’t ﬁ nd / has not found / had not found the way.’
While (3) consists of exclusively lexical items from German, we assume that its grammati-
cal structure exhibits traces of structural transfer from Russian. If we contrast the utterance with 
Standard German, it would correspond to Er hat den Weg nicht gefunden. But striking differ-
ences are the absence of the subjective pronoun, the exclusion of the object from the sentence 
bracket and the missing deﬁ nite article of the object. In typology, German and Russian are clas-
siﬁ ed as languages with SVO 9 basic word order with relatively free constituent orders. However, 
the contrasts in usage-based word order are rather intricate. Table 2 shows the relevant typolog-
ical features of German and Russian which have a crucial impact on the present investigation.

German has the characteristic feature of verb-ﬁ nal order (SOV) in subordinate clauses. 
Some linguists, like König and Gast, consider the SOV order in subordinate clauses as the ba-
sic word order for German. Among the arguments they give is the observation that German 
verbs with separable preﬁ xes like Ich will, dass Karl das Licht ausschaltet – Karl schaltet das 
Licht aus leave their preﬁ x behind in ﬁ nal position when they occur as ﬁ nite verbs in a main

clause [König, Gast 2009: 165]. This order of constituents is not possible in Russian, because 
it does not separate verbal preﬁ xes. Moreover, German has analytical forms of the perfect and 
past perfect, whereas Russian has a synthetic preterite form, which semantically corresponds 
to these tenses. If we translate (3) into Russian, as in (3′), we derive the perfective (singular 
masculine) past tense form našël from the Russian inﬁ nitive pair najti / naxodit’ ‘ﬁ nd’. The 
German translation offers the past, perfect and past perfect tenses. It should be noted that the 
purity of only three Russian tenses (present, past and future) is compensated for by the gram-
matical category of aspect, including a morphologically different perfect and imperfect form 
for almost every verbal inﬁ nitive.
Since the Russian past tense našël also denotes the masculine gender, the masculine pronoun 
can be dropped without losing this grammatical information. In (3), the temporal auxiliary hat 
does not mark the gender morphologically, but the pronoun is dropped anyway. In (3′), more-
over, the negation precedes the ﬁ nite verb – ne našël.
Another conspicuous difference is that the Siberian German perfect hat gefunde evokes 
the German “sentence bracket” (Germ. Satzklammer) including the negation nich in the mid-
dle ﬁ eld. In German, the ﬁ nite verb invariably occupies the second position in main clauses 
and exactly one constituent has to be placed in the position before the verb, in the so-called 
“foreﬁ eld” (Germ. Vorfeld). Thus, in Standard German the pro-drop in (3) is considered to be 
salient.
The non-ﬁ nite verb, here gefunde, typically occurs in ﬁ nal position. The position behind the 
non-ﬁ nite verb (“extraposition”) is called “postﬁ eld” (Germ. Nachfeld). It usually contains sub-
ordinate clauses (cf. [König, Gast 2009: 167]). As we can see, there are several contrasting gram-
matical features, which can trigger the morphosyntax of the contact variety.
The German sentence bracket is perhaps the crucial typological feature in the German variety 
which has resisted any structural change. A noticeable ﬁ nding is the exclusive usage of perfect 
tense when talking about the past 10. The structure of perfect tense causes the German sentence 
bracket. As mentioned above, there are no tokens of German past tense forms (except auxilia-
ries) in the entire SGC. This ﬁ nding does not seem to be a coincidence. Investigations on Colo-
nial German in Eastern Europe that are almost a hundred years old show the same empirical re-
sults in parts of Ukraine, Russia and the South Caucasus (Transcaucasia), cf. [Ström 1926/1927; 
Schirmunski [1926–1931/1992]. The past tense was already replaced by the perfect a hundred 
years ago. Table 3 illustrates the frequency of auxiliary usage in the SGC.

It is obvious that about half of the ﬁ nite verbs occurring in the SGC are variants of haben 
and sein followed by a lower frequency of the ﬁ nite forms of können and müssen. In the major-
ity of cases, haben is used in the perfect and past perfect, which build the sentence bracket. This 
strong structural contrast to Russian morphosyntax has not changed despite long-term language 
contact. Another interesting quantitative result is the substantial frequency of sein. Inﬂ ectional 
forms of sein are frequently used as copulas in nominal predicates, as in examples (4)–(6). In ta-
ble 4, we can see the variation of the ﬁ nite forms (types) of auxiliaries in the SGC.
 10 In written Standard German, the past tense has the meaning of a narrative tense used primarily for de-
scribing past narratives (cf. [Duden 2016: 523]).

The greatest amount of variation appears in the temporal auxiliaries haben and sein in the ﬁ rst 
and third person plural followed by the ﬁ rst and third person singular. The most frequent modal 
auxiliaries are müssen and können in the ﬁ nite forms of the ﬁ rst and third person plural. It is also 
obvious that the second person plural is not used in SGC (except habt, 13 tokens). In contrast, 
the occurrence and variation of the temporal auxiliary haben is very high, particularly in the ﬁ rst 
person plural (seven variants) and third person plural (six variants), for the frequency of the to-
kens see table 3. It means that the Siberian German speakers only use a few conjugational pat-
terns. In these patterns, the variation of forms is evidently high.
Furthermore, the occurrence and variation of the modal auxiliaries 12 sollen and möchten are 
very limited. The conjugational form soll appears 16 times, the form möchte only seven times and 
möchten eight times. In conclusion, it can be said that the usage of conjugational patterns of aux-
iliaries in SGC is limited to a few conjugational patterns of the auxiliaries haben and sein and the 
modal auxiliaries können and müssen. But the above discussed corpus data are difﬁ cult to explain. 
On the one hand the results show that Siberian German is still vital spoken language, but, on the 
other hand, the distribution of the conjugational patterns shows a limited ﬁ eld of verbal discourse.

iliary sein for instance appears in more than 19 different conjugational forms; every variant occurs 
in a number of tokens like bin (108), bist (9), war (460) etc., for more frequencies see table 3. The vari-
ety of conjugational forms can indicate the status of Siberian German: Spoken German, mixture of di-
alects, absence of Standard German etc.

The number of the subject does not correspond with the inﬂ ection of the copula war, as il-
lustrated in (4). In (6), the construction das sind does not correspond to the predicative billiger; 
in Standard German: Das ist ja auch billiger. Borrowing is an additional component in (5). In ad-
dition, in this case the number of the copula war does not match the number of the nominal pred-
icative voennye, as is required in Standard German. The Russian voennye ‘militaries’ is inserted 
as a nominal predicative; in Standard German it would be Es waren Soldaten. We argue that the 
bilingual speaker retrieves both Russian and German morphological rules: the Russian predica-
tive (plural) and the German (singular) copula war. We do not know how this cognitive process 
works, nor is it the topic of the present investigation. But we can make the argument by compar-
ing the existing structural parameters. In particular, both grammars can form a nominal predi-
cate using a copula — German sein or Russian byt’ — followed by a predicative, but the Russian 
copula is not realized in present tense. This means that the irregular personal forms of the Ger-
man copula sein (bin, bist, ist, sind, seid) correspond to a zero form in Russian. The German past 
tense forms of sein are war, warst, waren, wart, signalizing the categories of person and number, 
whereas the Russian past tense forms of byt’ are byl, byla, bylo, byli, signalizing the categories 
of number and gender, but not the category of person. Retrieving the morphologies of both lan-
guages, the speaker of the contact variety makes use of different rules from the two languages. 
The output is a contact-induced sentence construction constrained by both languages. To illus-
trate the underlying morphological diversity of the bilingual speech, the regular inﬂ ectional para-
digms of the verbs occurring in the SGC can be compared to German and Russian as follows:

German and Russian have two synthetic verb paradigms, non-past and past. In table 5, the 
paradigms of the regular verbs spielen and igrat’ ‘play’ are compared in person, number and gen-
der. The non-past tense forms in German and Russian mark person and number, and it is obvious 
that the German inﬂ ected forms show block syncretism, i.e. blocks of inﬂ ectional morphemes 
(cf. [Stump 2001: 217]); see also Synkretismusfelder, [Eisenberg 1998: 164]) in several cases: 
3�� and 2��, 1�� and 3�� in German non-past; 1�� and 3��, 1�� and 3�� in German past tense. 
This is not the case for the Russian non-past forms. The inﬂ ectional sufﬁ xes in the Russian verb 
differ for every person and number, while the Russian past tense forms are uninﬂ ected for per-
son, but inﬂ ected for number and also gender. But the grammatical category of gender appears 
neither in the Russian non-past paradigm nor in the German inﬂ ectional system.
We argue that the tension between partial uninﬂ ectedness (past) and form diversity (non-
past) in Russian on one hand and block syncretism in the German variety on the other hand are

responsible for several morphological contact phenomena, as will be discussed in the following 
analysis of bilingual verb units.
4. Types of inserted Russian verb morphemes 
in Siberian German
In his study of bilingual speech, Muysken [2000] investigated a large number of bilingual 
verb formations in several language pairs in order to explore different ways of borrowing for 
a speciﬁ c word class.13 He established four main types of bilingual verb constructions in typo-
logically different languages: (i) the new verb is inserted into a position corresponding to a na-
tive verb, in an adapted form or not; (ii) the new verb is adjoined to a “helping verb”; (iii) the 
new verb is a nominalized complement to a causative “helping verb” in a compound; (iv) the 
new verb is an inﬁ nitive and the complement of a native auxiliary [Ibid.: 184]. Muysken’s con-
tact-linguistic approach is clearly typological and general in nature, whereas the following anal-
ysis focuses on the particular case of inserted Russian verb morphemes in a German variety. The 
embedded Russian morphemes in the SGC are in all cases inserted into the position of a Ger-
man nonﬁ nite verb. That means the Russian morpheme occupies the position of a German per-
fect participle or an inﬁ nitive.
There are two options in German grammar to create non-ﬁ nite verb units: (1) the regular for-
mation of the perfect participle is the preﬁ x ge-, added to the verb stem, and the sufﬁ x -t; (2) the 
formation of the regular inﬁ nitive is the verb stem plus the sufﬁ x -en. Additionally, German ir-
regular verbs often have different stem paradigms as in schreib (present stem) and schrieb (past 
tense stem); the perfect participle of schreiben is geschrieben. But in the corpus under investi-
gation, bilingual verb units with the afﬁ xes ge- and -en do not occur. Therefore, it is not neces-
sary to discuss more verb inﬂ ections in German than just the regular one. In the SGC data, Rus-
sian verbs basically come as one of two main insertions:
a. The stem of a Russian verb is inserted into the position of the German perfect participle 
or inﬁ nitive and accompanied by German word-formation afﬁ xes.
b. The inﬂ ected form of a Russian verb is inserted into the position of the German perfect 
participle or inﬁ nitive without German afﬁ xes.
Following the classiﬁ cation by Muysken [2000: 184], only the insertion of a borrowed verb 
in an adapted or unadapted inﬂ ected form occurs in the SGC. The types (ii–iv) above were not 
found in the corpus under investigation. One reason is probably that German and Russian are 
both fusional languages building the inﬂ ectional systems by sufﬁ xes and changing their semantic 
and syntactic functions by preﬁ xes etc. But alongside the similarities, there are speciﬁ c morpho-
syntactic contrasts, as is illustrated above; see speciﬁ cally examples (3), (3′) and tables 2 and 5.
It is remarkable that in most of the examples in the SGC the inserted Russian verb units re-
main unadjusted to the morphosyntactic sentence structure in some way or other. The next sec-
tion contains a detailed analysis of the bilingual verbs discovered.
4.1. Russian verb stems with German word-formation afﬁ xes
In (7)–(10), Russian verb stems are integrated in the rest of the German sentence. There is 
no other lexical borrowing from Russian.
 13 In my view, this study is still the most extensive overview of morphosyntactic borrowings in verb for-
mations, but Russian borrowings are not mentioned.

The stems of the Russian verbs postupat’ ‘enter’, vstrečat’ ‘meet’, sobirat’ ‘collect’, opredeljat’ 
‘identify’ seem to be rather seamlessly integrated into the German verb morphology. In (7)–(8), 
the Russian stem takes the German sufﬁ x -e 14, and in (9)–(10), the Russian stem is integrated 
into the German perfect participle with the preﬁ x g- and the sufﬁ x -t, as summarized in table 6.

In example (7), the Russian stem takes the derivational preﬁ x hin- in addition to the inﬁ nitive 
sufﬁ x -e, while the borrowed Russian inﬁ nitive postupat’ does not have a preﬁ x. Furthermore, 
it is striking that the (bilingual) inﬁ nitive vstretschaje in (8) is used instead of a ﬁ nite verb and 
without the subject pronoun wir (‘we’).
Another crucial contrastive aspect affecting the morphology of bilingual verb forms is the 
existence of the verbal aspect in Russian. The selection of Russian verb stems by the bilin-
gual speaker is due to the fact that Russian verbal inﬁ nitives are systematically represented 
 14 In (8), the German Sufﬁ x -e has the grammatical function of an inﬁ nitive sufﬁ x because most of the 
verbal inﬁ nitives of SGC have the sufﬁ x -e. This is a common feature in various German dialects and 
not only typical for Siberian German. In contrast, the regular inﬁ nitive sufﬁ x in written German Stan-
dard is the sufﬁ x –(e)n (cf. [Duden 2016: 446]). But in several Spoken Regional Standard varieties one 
can also ﬁ nd the pronunciation [ə], i.e. the sufﬁ x -e. Moreover, the sufﬁ x -e (schwa) is one of the most 
syncretic sufﬁ xes in the German nominal and verbal inﬂ ectional system including the plural of mascu-
line and neutral nouns and the ﬁ rst person singular, present tense. In several Spoken German varieties, 
including SGC, the ﬁ rst person plural is often pronounced as schwa, transcribed as -e, like in example 
(2). However, discussing the various options here would go beyond the scope of the paper.
 15 The Standard German afﬁ xes appear in brackets.

by an inﬁ nitive pair, the perfective and the imperfective, see table 6. In the examples (7)–(10), 
the Russian verb stem is possibly derived from the imperfective inﬁ nitive. The vowel -a- in the 
stem of the hybrid forms in (7)–(10) could be an indication of the imperfective form. But this 
is only a cautious assumption. In this study, it is not possible and not intended to consider the 
functional-semantic category of aspectuality in the Russian embedded verb forms, which does 
not mean, however, that this functional opposition of the two aspectual inﬁ nitives is not rele-
vant. But the present study considers only the morphological form and not the function of this 
category.
However, this does not completely explain the existence of the formative -a- in the bilingual 
verbs. The choice of the imperfective Russian verb stem might be motivated by phonetic ana-
logy: if we separate the sufﬁ xes as -aje, -ajet, -ait, we arrive at potentially well-formed phonetic 
clusters in both languages. The phonetic value /ait/ is a part of several German stems such as ar-
beit ‘work’ 16, and /(a)je/ is a frequently occurring value in the SGC as in fraje ‘woman’ etc. But 
/aj/ is also the imperative singular in Russian verbs, and /ajet/ is the third person present tense 
in Russian verbs ending in -at’. It should be mentioned here that the Russian verb stems in (7)–
(10) belong to the ﬁ ve most productive verb classes in Modern Russian (cf. [Sidorov 1945]). 
These factors — phonetic similarity and morphological frequency — could be evidence for con-
tact-induced syncretism. At this point we argue with [Baerman et al. 2005] that a sort of nested 
syncretism is compounded across different environments as in the example of the West Slavonic 
language Upper Sorbian. In Upper Sorbian, “a-stem nouns have syncretism of the dative, loca-
tive in the singular, while all nominals have syncretism of the dative, locative and instrumental 
in the dual. Thus the syncretic pattern of the singular can be said to be nested within the larger 
syncretic pattern of the dual” [Baerman et al. 2005: 14].
This is also supported by Muysken’s [2000: 192] observation that in the case of verb inser-
tion, no extra structure is created, but the morphophonemic requirements of the language pair 
evokes the bilingual inﬁ nitive construction with an adapted stem, as in Dutch with French verb 
stems. French verbs can easily be integrated into Dutch when the stem is afﬁ xed with -er. How-
ever, the addition of -er to incorporate alien stems seems to be limited to French stems in stan-
dard Dutch, e.g. blesseren ‘hurt’ (< Fr. blesser). Muysken [Ibid.: 191] also found that Dutch bi-
lingual verbs which derive their stems from French -ir verbs also take the sufﬁ xes -er and -en 
as in offreren ‘offer’ (< Fr. offrir).
As in Dutch, the German sufﬁ xes -er and -en are very productive word-formation morphemes. 
Basically, the German inﬁ nitive sufﬁ x -en can be seamlessly afﬁ xed to most English verb stems 
like save — saven, start — starten, move — moven, while in the German variety of the SGC the 
Russian verb stems need an additional interﬁ x, as can be seen in (7)–(10), and also in table 6. 
Here it is undeniable that the language pair plays an important role in language contact.
In Standard Russian, verbs of foreign origin often need to be afﬁ xed with -ova-/-eva- fol-
lowed by the Russian inﬁ nitive sufﬁ x -t’ as in klassiﬁ cirovat’, stilizovat’, kollektivizirovat’ or re-
montirovat’. This morphological process also matters for the formation of bilingual verbs in the 
SGC as can be seen in (11):
(11) war          noch    remontiert    jez
���.���.3��   ���     ����          ���
war          noch    renoviert       jetzt
‘It was renovated then.’
The form remontiert is a Russian stem integrated in German verbal morphology. This is not 
necessarily obvious, because there is a verb remontieren in German — in fact, it is a seldom-used 
botanical term meaning ‘to blossom after the main ﬂ owering time’ (a French loan from remonter 
 16 Arbeit appears in SGC 77 times, the perfect participle gearbeit 15 times, but the phonetic value /ait/ is 
with a total frequency of 307 tokens strikingly often used in the SGC; for example, in the dialect verb 
forms geit and keit ‘goes’, steit ‘stands’ and in zeit ‘time’, krankheit ‘illness’ etc.
106 
Voprosy Jazykoznanija 
2019. № 6
‘wind up’). But the Russian loan verb remontirovat’ ‘renovate’ is a derivative of the noun remont 
and belongs to the class of ova/eva-stems, which often have interﬁ xes such as -ir- or -iz(-ir-) 
as in stilizovat’, kollektivizirovat’ etc. [Mulisch (ed.) 1975: 68].
The context of remontiert in the SGC deﬁ nitely supports the meaning of repair. However, the 
fact that the noun remont is also a loan in Russian makes it to an appropriate candidate for bilin-
gual word-formation because the morphophonemic similarity of the Russian interﬁ x -ir- in -iro-
vat’ and the German -ier- makes it easy to integrate the Russian stem into German morphology. 
The formation of the perfect participle with -ieren inﬁ nitives is frequently used in foreign loans 
such as diskutiert, pariert, fabriziert etc. Several verb tokens of passiert, palviert, interessiert 
etc. also appear in the GSC.
4.2. Bare inﬂ ected Russian verbs
A further group of inserted verb forms are inﬂ ected Russian verbs, as can be seen in exam-
ples (12)–(16). Most of the tokens found in the SGC are ﬁ nite forms or in few cases passive 
participles, but there are no borrowed inﬁ nitives.
As is well-known, inﬁ nitives are basic morphological forms in traditional grammar. Bare in-
ﬁ nitives also appear in several interim structures in ﬁ rst and second language acquisition. It is 
widely accepted that verbal inﬁ nitives occur in the two-word-phase of one year and 10 month 
old children as in sentences like Ball haben ‘ball have’; the morphological assignment is a later 
process [Müller 2013: 52].
Studies in second language acquisition with German as the second foreign language after En-
glish in Swedish schools show similar patterns. The learners choose the uninﬂ ected verb forms 
in an early phase using the sufﬁ xes -en and -t, but master the details of the different inﬂ ectional 
categories much later and often incompletely [Fredriksson 2006: 150–160].
However, in the present case of bilingualism, the speakers seem to avoid bare inﬁ nitives 
of the embedded language.

 Christiane Andersen 
107
In example (12), the inserted Russian apridilili is the past tense plural of the inﬁ nitive opre-
delit’. It correctly corresponds to the Siberian German subjective pronoun (nominative) mir ‘we’. 
This borrowed verb is also used in the SGC as an adapted form with German afﬁ xes — gapri-
dilait’, ‘realize’ — as is illustrated in (10).
A different case is example (15). In this case, the inserted form marinujut is the third person 
plural of the present tense of the corresponding inﬁ nitive marinovat’ ‘marinate’; but the subject 
emer ‘we have’ is the ﬁ rst-person plural!
In example (13), the Russian participle arendovan ‘rented’ is incorporated in place of the 
predicative complement with the German copula ist. The German sein-passive ist gemietet ‘is 
rented’ is replaced by the Russian equivalent, actually the short form of the past passive partici-
ple, masculine arendovan from the inﬁ nitive arendovat’. Standard Russian has four participles 
(present active and passive, past active and passive), but only the short form of the past passive 
participle occurs in the SGC.
(17) kvartira    arendovana
���.�        ����.��.�
‘The ﬂ at is rented.’
(17′) Die Wohnung ist gemietet.
‘Idem.’
As illustrated in (17), Russian perfective passive sentences are built synthetically from the 
short form of the passive participle, in this case with the inﬂ ectional sufﬁ x -a (feminine) in agree-
ment with the feminine noun kvartira ‘ﬂ at’. The copula byt’ ‘be’ is not realized in the present 
tense. Unlike Russian, the translated German construction (17′) realizes the copula ist in the 
present tense. This is also the case in the contact variety, as is illustrated in example (13). The 
insertion of the Russian noun kvartira in (13) is particularly apparent because of the use of the 
corresponding German deﬁ nite article die in the feminine form and the Russian participle aren-
dovan. As can be seen in (17), gender agreement between subjective pronoun and predicative 
participle is obligatory in Russian. But in the German variety, see (13), the masculine form ar-
endovan is used.
In example (14), the inﬂ ected verb tantsuju (1��, ���; from the inﬁ nitive tancevat’ ‘dance’) 
is inserted in the verbal predicate sind gange tantsuju. The word order is ������-���������-��-
���� (borrowing).
In example (16), the imperative provozhaj (���, �� from inﬁ nitive provozhat’ ‘see off ’) 
is inserted together with the bilingual inﬁ nitive vstretschaje, discussed in (8), literally trans-
lated as “Begleite das alte Jahr und treffen das neue Jahr um 12 Uhr”. Still, the morphological 
non-alignment of the borrowed verbs is in a way pragmatically motivated. The grammatical 
function ‘invitation’ is an inherent feature of the Russian imperative.
5. Summarizing discussion
Based on assumptions of language typology and related principles of Natural Morphology, 
inﬂ ectional forms (a) “are (in general) more often and more systematically subject to analogi-
cal leveling than derivationally related words […]”, (b) inﬂ ections are “(prototypical) catego-
ry-constant”, and (c) “inﬂ ectional formatives usually have a peripheral position in the word 
form” [Dressler (ed.) 1987: 5–6].
In the analysis of tokens of inserted Russian verbs occurring in the SGC, a striking amount 
of variation in morpheme combination and types of insertion has been discovered, but it has 
become obvious that the borrowed inﬂ ectional formatives basically show the features named 
in (a–c) above.
108 
Voprosy Jazykoznanija 
2019. № 6
The variation of borrowed morphemes has to be related to the quantitative patterns of the ﬁ -
nite and nonﬁ nite verbs occurring in the corpus. In contrast to the large number of monolingual 
ﬁ nite verbs, the occurrence of nonﬁ nite verbs is much smaller (see table 1), and the number of bi-
lingual nonﬁ nite verbs is even lower. However, the bilingual verbs investigated show promising 
results. Here I want to turn around Myers-Scotton’s [2002: ix] thesis that “not anything struc-
tural is possible in contact speech,” and ask: what is possible in bilingual speech when German 
is contrasted with Russian in this contact variety?
First, it has been shown that the system of inﬂ ectional sufﬁ xes which are added to German 
verb stems do not show any morphological borrowing from the Russian verbal inﬂ ection over 
a period of 200 years. On the other hand, the variation of monolingual German verb sufﬁ xes is 
high compared to Standard German inﬂ ection (see table 4). It is especially signiﬁ cant for 1��, 
���/���: , -en, -n, -e, -t, -mr, -te and 3��, ���/���: , -en, -n, -e, -t, -te, which correspond to -en 
(���.1/3��) and -ten (���.1/3��) in Standard German.
Second, the inserted Russian verb forms in the SGC have the shape of an inﬂ ected form with 
or without German inﬂ ectional afﬁ xes, and these verbs are sometimes loans from other European 
languages. The total number of formatives in bilingual verbs is shown systematically in table 7.

In one case, the derivational preﬁ x hin- was found, see example (7). But German preﬁ xes 
compounded with Russian stems have been found in other corpora as well. For this reason, 
we believe that the single case in the SGC is not an incidental ﬁ nding, see also example (1). 
 
 Christiane Andersen 
109
The preﬁ x hin- is otherwise a regularly used word-formation morpheme in the SGC, as can be 
seen in table 7.
The preﬁ x of the perfect participle g(e)- was found in several cases in combination with the 
corresponding sufﬁ x -t. Since ge- + ���� + -t is the regular formation of German perfect parti-
ciples, the preﬁ x g(e)- has the highest number of tokens in the SGC, see table 7. It is assumed 
that the bilingual formation of the German perfect participle with a Russian stem is the most 
regular bilingual formation in this German variety. This is conﬁ rmed by Berend, who gives 
many bilingual examples, including some without the preﬁ x but with the sufﬁ x -t, as in uznajt 
‘recognized’, machajt ‘waved’ etc. [Berend 2013: 89]. The formative -t- seems to be a very fre-
quently used morphophonemic element in the entire inﬂ ectional verb paradigm of the SGC. It 
therefore seems that the formative -t- is a contact-induced syncretic formative of spoken Ger-
man in Siberia. It is a noteworthy formative in bilingual verb formation, as well as in the Ger-
man conjugational paradigm, see table 4. Moreover, it also appears in the Russian non-past 
conjugation, see table 5. However, arguing for contact-induced inﬂ ectional syncretism is a bit 
risky. Several assumptions are required that these instances of “inﬂ ectional homophony” might 
be seen as systematic and “somehow represented in morphological structure” [Baerman et al. 
2005: 9]. But of course this question seldom has a clear-cut answer. The most rigorous ana-
lysis of distinct pattern identity is given by Pike [1965]. He isolated the phoneme sequences 
of the German irregular verb sein ‘be’ and found identity in the elements /b/, /z/, /ai/, /ist/, /in/, 
/n/, and /t/, as in table 8.

In spite of the fact that this proposal is not compatible with most morphological models,17 the 
resulting parts are suitable for the present analysis of contact-induced verbal morphology. It is 
argued that the formatives -ai-, -t, -n, and also -( j)e form very productive patterns in the bilin-
gual verb morphology, see table 8. The special aspect here is that these formatives occur in Rus-
sian, Standard German and also in spoken German in Siberia. The formatives are part of either 
the German or the Russian inﬂ ectional paradigm and merge in the bilingual morphological con-
text. They do not have exactly the same function, but they are part of the system of verbal mor-
phology. We propose here that they belong to the contact-induced syncretic inﬂ ectional system.
Finally, we should discuss the Russian inﬂ ectional sufﬁ xes -ili, -uju, and -ujut. In contrast 
to the formatives discussed above, they do not have analogous morphophonemic forms in Ger-
man, but occur relatively frequently as Russian inﬂ ectional sufﬁ xes in the SGC, see table 7. 
As we saw in examples (12), (14), and (15), the inﬂ ectional morphemes -uju, -ujut have the func-
tional values of grammatical person and number, and -ili only marks number, see example (12) 
and table 5. In the Russian inﬂ ectional system, they may be ﬁ nite verbs, but in the contact-in-
duced context they appear in the position of the German perfect participle.
 17 Baerman et al. [2005: 9] argue that these patterns of identity may be suitable for a speciﬁ c analysis, but 
are not desirable in the context of a large-scale typological investigation. But for a contrastive analysis 
such as ours, this proposal represents a promising approach.

6. Conclusion
This investigation has demonstrated that in a mixed language (the variety of Siberian Ger-
man) the bilingual verb formations (Russian as the contact language) follow morphophonemic 
regularities to a certain extent:
1. The borrowed Russian inﬂ ectional morphemes are exclusively units of Russian verbal 
morphology, i.e. the diversity of borrowed morphemes is restricted.
2. The borrowed morphemes under discussion are derived from Russian verb stems belong-
ing to the ﬁ ve most productive verb classes in Modern Russian.
3. There are obviously several traces of syncretism in the entire verbal inﬂ ectional system 
including cross-linguistic verb constructions.
However, in spite of the regularities we uncovered, we can neither explain precisely why 
just those morphemes were chosen, nor can we say with certainty if these formatives are reg-
ular morphemes. If we ﬁ nally have a look at the internal structure of the bilingual verb gapri-
dilait ‘identiﬁ ed’ (example 10), components such as g- or ga-, apridilai- or pridil-, -ait or -ai- 
and -t etc. could be possible morphological units of this bilingual token, if we assume the clas-
sical morphological approach 18 of word-formation, i.e. that words consist of morphemes that 
are minimal meaningful units in language. However, the formatives investigated in the SGC do 
not have exactly the same form/function equivalents in both the German and Russian morpho-
logical systems. It is argued here that the bilingual speakers make use of German and Russian 
morphology in an innovative way and that this becomes apparent through the production of new 
(bilingual) types of verb formation. The high degree of variation in the verbal inﬂ ectional sys-
tem of this German variety could be another indication of innovative morphological rules in-
duced by language contact.
For further research, it may be productive to focus speciﬁ cally on cognitive aspects in bilin-
gual morphology, taking into account different forms of language acquisition and other types 
of bilingualism.
