Abstract : This study seeks to examine the lexical category of adjective in Persian using the Typological 
Prototype Theory (TPT) as its theoretical framework. This study aims to (a) evaluate TPT in determin-
ing the prototypical features of Persian adjectives, (b) account for the morphological and syntactic dif-
ferences between prototypical and non-prototypical adjectives in Persian, and (c) determine the associ-
ation between frequency of occurrence and prototypicality of Persian adjectives. Having collected the 
data from Persian Language Database as w ell as Bijankhan Corpus and analyzed them based on the 
criteria and sub-criteria of TPT, we concluded that TPT can distinguish between Persian adjectives de-
noting property, action and object, but is actually incapable of accounting for the behavioral diﬀ erences 
among the sub-categories of these adjectives due to the insuﬃ  cient set of criteria and sub-criteria pro-
posed for this purpose. Actually, this theory could prove more helpful in distinguishing between pro-
totypical and non-prototypical parts of speech if it had considered the monosemy and polysemy phe-
nomena, more various syntactic functions of POS, diﬀ erent morphological features like derivation, and 
class range. It was also shown in this research that there exists a relationship between the traditional-
ly-categorized adjective types in Persian and their degree of prototypicality, in such a way that prop-
erty adjectives and object adjectives are the most and the least prototypical respectively, while the ac-
tion adjectives are in between them in terms of prototypicality.

Аннотация: В данной статье лексическая категория прилагательных в персидском языке исследуется 
с точки зрения теории типологических прототипов (ТТП). Цель исследования заключается в том, 
чтобы (а) оценить возможности ТТП в выявлении прототипических свойств лексической катего-
рии на материале персидских прилагательных, (б) описать морфологические и синтаксические 
различия между прототипическими и непрототипическими прилагательными в персидском языке 
и (в) определить связь между частотностью персидских прилагательных и степенью их прототи-
пичности. Собрав данные из двух корпусов персидского языка и проанализировав их в соответ-
ствии с критериями ТТП, мы приходим к выводу, что данный подход позволяет различить при-
лагательные с семантикой качества, объекта и действия, но не позволяет учесть различия в упо-
треблении между более мелкими подклассами прилагательных, поскольку предлагаемый набор

критериев для этого недостаточен. Данная теория могла бы более эффективно различать прото-
типические и непрототипические части речи, если бы учитывала явление полисемии, большее 
количество синтаксических функций частей речи, словообразование и размер категорий. В ста-
тье также демонстрируется наличие связи между традиционно выделяемыми типами прилага-
тельных в персидском языке и степенью их прототипичности: прилагательные с семантикой ка-
чества ближе всего к прототипу, прилагательные с семантикой объекта — дальше всего от него, 
в то в время как прилагательные с семантикой действия находятся в этом отношении посередине.

Introduction
Parts of speech (POS) are the basic linguistic categories in a language which play a key role 
in most syntactic theories and morphological analyses. They are “classes of words established 
primarily on the basis of grammar, where they occur in clauses, what words they combine with 
and pattern of agreement and government” [Brown, Miller 2013: 474]. It is not easy to deﬁ ne 
POS because they have, besides their unmarked usages, extended and marked usages so that 
a particular syntactic function may be fulﬁ lled by diﬀ erent lexical categories. This is why Hen-
geveld [1992] used the phrase “without further measures being taken” in his deﬁ nitions of POS 
including adjectives 1, by which he means the marked and unmarked functions of POS. As one 
of the most important POS found in most languages of the world, adjective is no exception to this 
rule and has many extended uses in Persian.
The traditional grammarians of the Persian language have described and categorized adjec-
tives in this language based on semantic and/or morphosyntactic factors, but as we know, mere 
emphasis on these factors cannot account for diﬀ erent functions of this POS in this language, 
because adjectives do not have identical behavior and features. This is why we have to resort 
to the Prototype Theory (PT) which considers the members of a set to be hierarchical and unequal, 
unlike the Aristotelian Set Theory, which posits that all members of a category or set are equal. 
The PT emphasizes inequality of the members of a category [Lakoﬀ  1987]; that is, a lexical cat-
egory has central members with all or most of the features of that category and peripheral mem-
bers with fewer such features. Typological Prototype Theory (TPT), which is the framework for 
this research, is a typological-functional approach developed by Croft, according to which typo-
logical prototypes are deﬁ ned based on function and are universal and cross-linguistically valid 
[Croft 2001: 84]. He proposes that prototypical adjectives have the semantic function of “prop-
erty” and the pragmatic function of “modiﬁ cation”. In comparison with the peripheral mem-
bers, the central members of a category, which are typological prototypes, have higher frequency 
of occurrence, less morphological marking and a full behavioral potential [Croft 2003: 1630].
The present research is an attempt to investigate Persian adjectives from the typological proto-
type perspective. The two main criteria used in this approach to distinguish prototypical members 
from the peripheral ones are structural coding and behavioral potential. The behavioral potential 
criterion for adjectives consists of attributive and predicative function, gradability, and frequency 
of occurrence. Obviously, adjectives used both attributively and predicatively are more proto-
typical than those used either attributively or predicatively. Furthermore, adjectives which can 
merely be used attributively are more prototypical than those that can only be used predicatively, 
because the attributive function is the unmarked usage of adjectives. The gradability sub-crite-
rion, manifested in Persian in comparative and superlative forms, intensifying adverbs and the 
 
1 “An adjectival predicate is a predicate which, without further measures being taken, can be used 
as a modiﬁ er of a nominal head.” [Hengeveld 1992: 37]

reduplication process, will also be used to determine how prototypical an adjective is. The last 
sub-criterion used in this study is the frequency of occurrence, according to which the more fre-
quently an adjective is used, the more central or prototypical it is. To determine the frequency 
of adjectives, we will use the Persian Language Database [PLDB] as well as [Bijankhan Corpus].
This is a descriptive-analytical research conducted using the content analysis method. The 
research data have been collected from PLDB and Bijankhan Corpus. Besides, a part of the raw 
data was provided by the researchers in such a way that the researchers found suitable adjec-
tives related to diﬀ erent categories and classiﬁ ed them within the framework of TPT. The col-
lected data will be analyzed and diﬀ erent limitations imposed by the Persian language on the 
use of adjectives will be described and discussed. Since the parts of speech simultaneously do 
one of the propositional acts of modiﬁ cation, predication or reference on the one hand, and be-
long to one of the semantic categories of property, object or action on the other, they can be di-
vided into <modiﬁ cation, property>, <modiﬁ cation, object>, <modiﬁ cation, action>, <reference, 
property>, <reference, object>, <reference, action>, <predication, property>, <predication, ob-
ject>, and <predication, action>. As adjectives in attributive position perform the propositional 
act of modiﬁ cation, they belong to <modiﬁ cation, property>, <modiﬁ cation, object>, or <mod-
iﬁ cation, action>. In order to analyze these three types of adjectives in terms of prototypicality, 
we will select several lexemes of each type and analyze their prototypicality status based on the 
criteria of the Typological Prototype Approach.
The present research seeks to answer the following questions:
 
1. Can TPT determine the prototypical features of Persian adjectives?
 
2. How do Persian prototypical and non-prototypical adjectives diﬀ er morphosyntactically?
 
3. How are the traditionally categorized adjectives of Persian associated with prototypi cality?
Considering the fact that no independent research has been conducted on prototypicality 
of diﬀ erent types of Persian adjectives yet, the present research can ﬁ ll the existing gap and thus 
prove helpful for the Persian language and linguistics as well as for translators. Besides, an im-
portant point having been neglected in the existing Persian dictionaries is inclusion of informa-
tion about the attributive and predicative functions of words, which is largely due to the fact that 
such an important issue is still under research in the Persian language.
1. Previous studies
Due to the importance of adjective as one of the main parts of speech, most Persian gram-
mar books have dealt with the deﬁ nition, description, and formation of adjectives, but very few 
of them have actually discussed their diﬀ erent attributive and predicative functions and the lim-
itations imposed by the Persian language on diﬀ erent usages of them. Moreover, the Persian 
grammar books currently available to readers have mostly conﬁ ned themselves within the tra-
ditional framework, rather than based on modern linguistic theories, although we should never 
deny the importance of the traditionally-based studies and the large contributions that they have 
made to our knowledge about Persian grammar. We ﬁ rst introduce these traditionally-based 
sources and then go to other books or articles written based on modern linguistic theories. We 
will end this section with an overview of the books and sources written in and about languages 
other than Persian which concern the research topic and TPT.
Persian grammarians have provided similar deﬁ nitions of adjective and described and cat-
egorized this POS mainly based on the semantic criterion. Natel Khanlari [1964: 179] deﬁ nes 
adjective as a word modifying a noun and divides Persian adjectives into descriptive, numer-
ical, demonstrative, interrogative and indeﬁ nite types. This author adds that descriptive ad-
jectives in Contemporary Persian precede nouns, although they used to act as postmodiﬁ ers 
in the ancient literature. Sadeghi and Arjang [1979: 3] claim that Persian adjectives can all act 
 
 Amin Karimi, Vali Rezai 
107
as nominals, adding that some of them are used both adjectivally and nominally simultaneously. 
Gharib et al. [1984: 47] divide adjectives in Persian into subjective, objective, comparative and 
attributive types. Shafaei [1984: 20] mentions some practical limitations of the usage of adjec-
tives in Persian, including the fact that some of them are rarely used comparatively and superla-
tively, because they are derived from nouns. Moreover, he asserts that subjective adjectives take 
complements and are thus to be regarded as marked adjectives, as they are derived from verbs.
Zamanian [1990: 60] suggests that some of the Persian subjective adjectives are used with the 
meaning of objective adjectives and vice versa. Monshizadeh [2004] deﬁ nes adjective of ability 
as a type of verbal adjective that refers to the future tense in terms of the category of mode. He 
divides verbal adjectives into objective and subjective types depending on the transitivity or in-
transivity of the verb from which the adjective is derived.
Meshkatoddini [2004: 84] asserts that some adjectives such as javân ‘young’, dânâ ‘knowl-
edgeable’ and siâhpoust ‘black’ can also be used as nominals, and some adjectives such as zende 
‘live’, morde ‘dead’, mozakar ‘male’ and xâmuš ‘switched oﬀ ’ cannot normally be used in com-
parative and superlative forms.
Although most of the sources available to readers are based on traditional views rather 
than modern linguistic theories, there are a few books and articles dealing with Persian ad-
jectives based on the modern linguistic views and criticizing the traditionally-based sources. 
For example, Bateni [1970: 71] argues that the deﬁ nitions having been given for POS in Per-
sian grammar books so far are mostly based on their meanings rather than on the formal re-
lations and functions, and this is why such deﬁ nitions are for the most part misleading and 
inaccurate. He exempliﬁ es it with the the word tâze ‘new’ in three sentences being used 
as diﬀ erent categories:
(1) 
Ali   yek   ketâb-e   tâze   xar-id.
Ali   one   book-��   new    buy-���.3��
‘Ali bought a new book.’
(2) 
Hame-ye   tâze-hâ   piš-e       šomâ   ast.
all-��        new-��    beside-��   you     be.���.3��
‘You have all the news.’
(3) 
Rezâ   tâze   âmad-e     ast.
Reza   new    come-����   be.���.3��
‘Reza has just (lit. “newly”) come.’
The word tâze is used in the above sentences as an adjectival, a nominal and an adverbial re-
spectively.
Sasani [2001] has used a fuzzy approach to investigate parts of speech and their similarities 
and diﬀ erences in Persian and found that lexical categories have no clear-cut boundary in this 
language. He argues that lexical categories have unmarked functions as well as marked, less 
common, or peripheral functions which do not necessarily overlap with the primary function 
of other lexical classes. He adds that not all Persian adjectives can be used both predicatively 
and attributively.
As mentioned earlier, there are only few books and articles in Persian having dealt with the 
research topic and its theoretical framework. Now, let us introduce a few of the studies conducted 
in and about languages other than Persian concerning the research topic and TPT.
Sasse [1993: 661] argues that the prototypical function of adjectives lies in their attributive 
rather than predicative usage, because adjectives merely have attributive function in a large 
number of languages of the world. Dixon [2004: 37] divides adjectives into 13 semantic cores 
of dimension — age, value, color, physical property, human propensity, speed, diﬃ  culty, simi-
larity, quality, quantity, location, and ordinals — out of which adjectives which denote the ﬁ rst 
four characteristics are prototypical. He further calls some non-prototypical adjectives as either 
“nouny” or “verby”.
108

Tribushinina [2008] investigated adjectives of color and dimension in terms of prototypical-
ity, coming to the conclusion that adjectives of dimension are less prototypical than adjectives 
of color. She further divided color adjectives into focal and non-focal adjectives in terms of fea-
tures including cognitive salience, usage, importance and being simple or compound.
Mpofu [2009] carried out a study on prototypicality of Shona adjectives. She used attributive 
position, predicative position, agreement, gradability and frequency as some criteria to distin-
guish prototypical adjectives from peripheral ones in this language and claimed that prototypi-
cal adjectives are those that can meet all of the above-mentioned criteria.
Although many studies have been conducted concerning TPT and the lexical category of ad-
jective in diﬀ erent languages so far, the books and articles available on the lexical category 
of adjective in Persian have mainly used the traditional rather than typologically-oriented ap-
proaches in their analyses. This is why we have chosen to investigate Persian adjectives using 
TPT, which is a functional-typological framework argued to be universally applicable to all lan-
guages of the world.
2. Theoretical framework
This research has been conducted within the framework of the Universal-Typological Proto-
type Theory, presented by Croft [1991; 2001; 2003]. Before we deal with this universal theory, 
we prefer to give a brief explanation of the general Prototype Theory.
2.1. The Prototype Theory
The Prototype Theory (PT) postulates that categories are formed around prototypes and re-
semblance to the prototype, and not according to a yes-or-no distinction [Ungerer, Schmid 
1996: 14]. A prototype may be deﬁ ned as the most representative, or most salient, instance 
of a schema [Taylor 2003: 591], or the clearest, central or best member of a category. Rosch and 
Mervis [1975] state that the prototypical members of a category have more attributes in com-
mon with other members of the same category, but display fewer attributes common with mem-
bers of contrasting categories. The major premises of the PT are that: a) a category has central 
and peripheral members, b) category membership is a matter of degree, and c) categories have 
fuzzy boundaries. Cognitive approaches in linguistics, therefore, regard linguistic categories 
as prototype notions with fuzzy boundaries and state that a category consists of prototypical and 
non-typical members [Langacker 1987; Croft 2003; Taylor 2003]. POS are also seen as con-
sisting of a prototype, that is, the central or core member that has all the necessary features for 
that category; and boundary cases that extend from the prototype to other members in other 
categories, what Croft [2003: 163] refers to as peripheral members, and that these members do 
not display the full behavioral potential that a central member displays. Langacker [1987: 14] 
believes that m uch of a language is a matter of degree. Linguistic relationships are not invari-
ably all-or-nothing aﬀ airs, nor are linguistic categories always sharply deﬁ ned along the edges.
2.2. The Universal-Typological Prototype Theory
The Universal-Typological Prototype Theory is a cognitive theory which investigates lan-
guage facts on the basis of function, focusing on how grammatical structures are represented 
in the mind of the speaker [Croft 2001: 3]. This theory combines modiﬁ cations based on semantic

class and discourse functions. Croft [2001: 87] asserts that the semantic classes of objects, prop-
erties, and actions are the typological prototypes of referring, attributive, and predicative con-
structions respectively. He adds that these three propositional acts should be able to describe the 
referring, predicative and attributive constructions of any language.
Croft further discusses the propositional acts on the basis of four semantic criteria, namely, 
valency, stativity, transitoriness and gradability. Valency refers to the inherent relationality 
of a concept or the number of “arguments” required by the concept. Nouns are said to have a va-
lency of zero because they are do not need reference to another concept, while adjectives and 
verbs are inherently relational with adjectives having a valency of 1, whereas verbs have a va-
lency of 1 and above. Stativity refers to whether a concept is a state or a process, while transito-
riness refers to whether the concept is a transitory state, a process or a permanent state. As Croft 
points out, only states are permanent. The last criterion, gradability, refers to whether a concept 
is gradable. Croft’s hypothesis is that these four semantic criteria should be able to describe the 
semantic classes of objects, actions and properties.
The typological prototypes are unmarked in their respective functions of reference, modiﬁ ca-
tion and predication. In their prototypical function, POS do not require any additional morphemes 
in order to encode a particular function. This unmarked function is also referred to by Croft 
as zero structural coding function [2001: 89]. Croft further highlights that the semantic class and 
propositional act functions dichotomy constitute the typologically unmarked prototypes. In light 
of this hypothesis, Croft deﬁ nes POS as follows: noun = reference to an object; adjective = mod-
iﬁ cation by a property; and verb = predication of an action. However, a property word may also 
be used as a referring expression, while an action word may also be used as a modiﬁ er. In order 
to be able to perform these non-prototypical functions, the respective POS would require to be 
overtly marked by additional morphemes, what Croft [2001: 88] calls overt structural coding 
or typological markedness, and this is presented in Table 1.

The table above shows that prototypical adjectives are those which belong to the semantic cat-
egory of property and which perform the propositional act of modiﬁ cation. Other types of adjec-
tives such as participles, which do not belong to the semantic category of property, are marked 
and peripheral members of the adjective category.
3. Methodology
This is a descriptive-analytical research conducted using the content analysis method. The 
required data have been collected from two great corpora of the Persian language, namely the 
Persian Language Database [PLDB] and [Bijankhan Corpus]. The former is a software package 
with various texts of Persian including the vernacular, formal, stylistic and practical varieties. 
This corpus includes important literary works such as poetry, stories, drama, children’s litera-
ture, newspapers, and literary and scientiﬁ c periodicals. The latter is a tagged corpus suitable 
110 
Voprosy Jazykoznanija 
2020. № 2
for natural language processing research on the Persian language. This collection is gathered 
from daily news and non-specialized texts. In this collection, all documents are categorized into 
diﬀ erent subjects such as political, cultural, etc.; there are about 4300 diﬀ erent subject catego-
ries. The corpus contains about 2.6 million manually tagged words with a tag set that contains 
550 Persian part-of-speech tags. To achieve more reliable results, we have used the two cor-
pora so that our data can actually represent the usage in Contemporary Persian. Besides, a part 
of the raw data was provided by the researchers in such a way that the researchers found suit-
able adjectives related to diﬀ erent categories and classiﬁ ed them within the framework of TPT. 
The collected data were then analyzed and diﬀ erent limitations on the use of adjectives were 
described and discussed.
As shown above, there are three types of propositional acts and three basic semantic catego-
ries, so that there are nine theoretically possible usages for a paticular word. As the present re-
search is an attempt to determine the prototypicality of descriptive adjectives and descriptive ad-
jectives perform the propositional act of modiﬁ cation, we can divide these adjectives into three 
types, namely, <modiﬁ cation, property>, <modiﬁ cation, object>, and <modiﬁ cation, action>, 
and analyze these types in terms of prototypicality.
4. Prototypicality of Persian adjectives
We divide Persian descriptive adjectives into three types: <modiﬁ cation, property>, <modiﬁ -
cation, object>, and <modiﬁ cation, action>, and then analyze them separately in terms of proto-
typicality. To distinguish prototypical adjectives from non-prototypical ones, we use two criteria 
of TPT; namely structural coding and behavioral potential. The latter consists of three sub-crite-
ria, namely gradability, attributive and predicative functions, and frequency of occurrence.
4.1. The <modiﬁ cation, property> adjectives
This type of adjectives are descriptive and morphologically simple adjectives (i.e. not de-
rived from other adjectives) such as bozorg ‘big’, zibâ ‘beautiful’, xub ‘good’, bad ‘bad’, sangin 
‘heavy’, čâq ‘fat’ and so on. Now we evaluate the prototypicality of this type of adjectives based 
on the criteria and sub-criteria of TPT:
4.1.1. Structural coding
These adjectives are to be regarded as prototypical based on this criterion, because most 
of them have received no aﬃ  x to perform the propositional act of modiﬁ cation 2.
 
2 It is noteworthy that a few of such adjectives such as mehrbân ‘kind’ and sangin ‘heavy’ are diachron-
ically derivative adjectives, but synchronically speaking, they are considered in the mind of Persian 
speakers as simplex rather than derivative due to unproductivity of the aﬃ  xes used in their construc-
tion. In other words, few Persian speakers consider sangin to be made up of sang ‘stone’ + in. However, 
this is not always the case, as there are some other such constructions the constituents of which are eas-
ily reminded by Persian speakers while they are used. For example, upon hearing the adjectives rangin 
‘colored’, khashmgin ‘angry’ and ghamgin ‘sad’, all Persian speakers grasp their meaning through their 
main constituents, namely rang ‘color’, khashm ‘fury’, and gham ‘grief’, respectively. Therefore, the 
latter group of adjectives are derivatives both diachronically and synchronically, while sangin is a de-
rived adjective only diachronically.

4.1.2. Behavioral potential
Gradability. To test the gradability of the <modiﬁ cation, property> adjectives, we review the 
comparative use of some of these adjectives in the two corpora used in the research:
(4) 
noh-sa        sâl    zamin    se     barâbar   bozorg-tar   šod.
nine-hundred   year   Earth     three   times       big-����     become.���.3��
‘The Earth became bigger three times as much for nine hundred years.’
(5) 
javân-ân   be   xâter-e     moqeiyat-e   behtar   xud   râ   molzam   be   vorud
young-��   to    thought-��   position-��     better     self   ���   required   to    enter
 
be   dânešgâh   na-dân-and.
to    university    ���-know-3��
‘The youth should not consider it necessary for themselves to enter the university in or-
der to attain a better position.’
These sentences show that the <modiﬁ cation, proper ty> adjectives are gradable and thus pro-
totypical in this respect. However, it should be noted that prototypicality consists of a set of com-
ponents, and thus adjectives which are used comparatively and superlatively are not equally pro-
totypical; gradability is a necessary but insuﬃ  cient condition for prototypicality of adjectives. 
The following criteria shuold be met as well.
Attributive and predicative uses of the <modiﬁ cation, property> adjectives can be illus-
trated with the following sentences:
(6) 
radio   ke     bâ    sedâ-ye     boland   be   kâr    oftâd,
radio    when   with   volume-��   loud      to    work   begin
 
pedar   nafas-i      be    asudegi    keš-id.
father    breath-����   with   relaxation   take-���.3��
‘When the radio began working with a loud volume, father felt quite relaxed.’
(7) 
zabân     va    nahve-ye   motafâvet-e   zendegi-ye   mardom
language   and   way-��      diﬀ erent-��     life-��        people 
 
barây-e   man   jâleb       ast.
for-��     me     interesting    be.���.3��
‘People’s language and way of life are interesting to me.’
The sentences above show that the <modiﬁ cation, property> adjectives can be used in both 
attributive and predicative positions and there is no limitation as to their attributive and predica-
tive usages. This type of adjectives can thus be considered prototypical in this respect.
Frequency of occurrence. The adjectives of this class hav e a very high frequency of use. 
The ﬁ ve adjectives of this category presented in Table 2 are just a few examples of these very 
frequently used adjectives.
The table shows that both positive and comparative forms of the <modiﬁ cation, property> ad-
jectives have a high frequency of occurrence in the corpora, which conﬁ rms that they are proto-
typical. To sum up, we can say that the <modiﬁ cation, property> adjectives have met all crite-
ria and sub-criteria of TPT well enough. However, not all members of this category are equally 
prototypical, meaning that their prototypicality can be shown along a continuum. The following 
graph shows the frequency of occurrence of this type of adjectives in the corpora.
The graph (Figure 1) shows that bozorg is the most frequently-used and  jâleb is the least fre-
quently-used adjectives in the <modiﬁ cation, property> type examined in this research, and the 
other adjectives are in between A noteworthy point is that we tested 20 adjectives from each 
category and found that they had similar responses to the criteria and sub-criteria of the Typo-
logical Prototype Theory, but for practical purposes we have enlisted only a few representative 
adjectives from each category in the tables and graphs.

Figure 1. Frequency of the positive <modiﬁ cation, property> adjectives
4.2. The <modiﬁ cation, object> adjectives
 The <modiﬁ cation, object> adjectives are noun-derived adjectives such as mardâne ‘man-
like’, rangin ‘colorful’, and tehrâni ‘Tehrani’. They are referred to in traditional grammar as re-
lational adjectives. Most of them do not have comparative and superlative forms: *axlâq-e 
pezeškitar (lit. “more medical ethics”), *extelâfât-e qânunitar (lit. “more legal disputes”), *ﬁ zik-e 
hasteeitar (lit. “more nuclear physics”).
 
3 This is a suppletive form commonly used as the comparative form of xub in Persian, although xubtar is 
also rarely used in that sense. However, this word is used so frequently by Persian speakers that most 
of them conceive of it as a separate positive form, which may account for its higher frequency than that 
of other comparative adjectives.

The noteworthy point is that not all of the adjectives belonging to the <modiﬁ cation, object> 
category have equal practical limitations; rather some of them have more limitations and are 
thus more marked than others. Actually, the high frequency of some of these adjectives cause 
them to take semantic content, and thus move from marked towards unmarked along the marked-
ness continuum. For example, châmskiayi ‘Chomskyan’ and esfahâni ‘Isfahani’ are sometimes 
used in a sense more than just denoting a type of relation to Chomsky and Isfahan respectively; 
rather, they sometimes denote a property usually attributed to these nouns. This is why we can 
talk of a person being “very Isfahani” (having a particular property attributed to Isfahani peo-
ple) or even “more Isfahani” than another one. We may then say that there is no clear-cut bound-
ary between the so-called relational and descriptive adjectives, as we sometimes encounter the 
process when a particular relational adjective goes away the <modiﬁ cation, object> prototype 
and approaches the <modiﬁ cation, property> category. This is also the case about adjectives 
like axmu ‘fretful’ and tarsu ‘timid’, which have originally been derived from nouns, but are 
considered property adjectives by Persian speakers due to their high frequency as well as their 
fossilized aﬃ  xes. This is why they are used in comparative and superlative forms as frequently 
as the normally categorized <modiﬁ cation, property> adjectives, which shows that there are 
fuzzy boundaries between the members of a particular category. Now, we examine the proto-
typicality degree of this type of adjectives based on the criteria of TPT.
4.2.1. Structural coding
Considering the fact that these adjectives are the result of noun suﬃ  xation, the existence 
of these suﬃ  xes shows that they are structurally coded and thus far from prototypical adjectives.
4.2.2. Behavioral potential
Gradability. In normal circumstances, the <modiﬁ cation, object> adjectives cannot be used 
in comparative and superlative functions, although there are rare cases where they come to be 
used as property adjectives and thus take the comparative and superlative suﬃ  xes. An example is 
when we talk of a woman having a more mardâne ‘manly’ appearance than another one, in which 
case mardâne is used as a <modiﬁ cation, property>, rather than a <modiﬁ cation, object> adjective.
Attributive and predicative usages. Having reviewed the corpuses to evaluate prototypical-
ity of the <modiﬁ cation, property> adjectives, we encountered the following sentences:
(8) 
dar   ân    ruz-e   bârâni    raftoâmad   qeire ’âdi   bud.
in     that   day-��   rainy      traﬃ  c        unusual      be.���.3��
‘There was an unusual traﬃ  c on that rainy day.’
(9) 
šab-e     âxar-i    ke    be   gardeš   raf-t-am    havâ     bârâni   bud.
night-��   last-����   that   to    picnic    go-���-1��   weather   rainy     be.���.3��
‘It was raining last night when I went on a picnic.’
However, certain <modiﬁ cation, object> adjectives are used in attributive position more fre-
quently than in predicative position. Consider the following sentences:
(10) modir     yek   hošdâr-e    axlâqi   be   ân-hâ   dâd.
manager   one   warning-��   ethical    to    that-��   give.���.3��
‘The manager gave them an ethical warning.’
(11) 
?hošdâr-e   modir     be   ân-hâ   (xeili)   axlâqi   bud.
warning-��   manager   to    that-��   (very)   ethical    be.���.3��
‘The manager’s warning to them was (very) ethical.’
114 
Voprosy Jazykoznanija 
2020. № 2
The two sentences show that axlâqi in the NP hošdâr-e axlâqi ‘ethical warning’ cannot be 
used predicatively. We may then say that the <modiﬁ cation, object> adjectives are more marked 
and peripheral than the <modiﬁ cation, property> adject ives. The researchers examined this cat-
egory of adjectives in terms of the criteria and sub-criteria of the Typological Prototype Theory 
and found that the adjectives of this category have the same behavior with respect to these cri-
teria and sub-criteria, some of which are presented in the following table:

As the table above shows, the <modiﬁ cation, object> adjectives can be considered proto-
typical in terms of attributive and predicative functions, but they are structurally coded as well 
as non-gradable. With every aspect of prototypical adjectives in mind, we may say that the 
<modiﬁ cation, object> adjectives are to be considered as non-prototypical, although they are 
by no means equally peripheral. Now we will see whether the sub-criterion frequency of occur-
rence conﬁ rms this conclusion or not.
4.2.3. Frequency of occurrence
The data from PLDB and Bijankhan Corpus shows that the adjectives of this class do not 
have high frequency of use. The ﬁ ve adjectives of this category presented in Table 4 are just 
a few examples. We also examined their comparative forms in order to conﬁ rm the gradability 
criterion of prototypicality.

The table above shows that <modiﬁ cation, object> adjectives are less frequently used in the 
corpuses than <modiﬁ cation, property> adjectives, and the comparative forms of such adjec-
tives have no frequency at all, which conﬁ rms that they are non-prototypical adjectives. To sum 
up, we can say that the <modiﬁ cation, object> adjectives do not meet some criteria and sub-cri-
teria of TPT. However, not all members of this type of adjectives are equally non-prototypical, 
meaning that their prototypicality can be shown along a continuum. The following graph shows 
the frequency of occurrence of the <modiﬁ cation, object> adjectives in the corpora.

Figure 2. Frequency of the positive <modiﬁ cation, object> adjectives
The above graph shows that the <modiﬁ cation, object> adjectives have a low frequency of oc-
currence in both Bijankhan Corpus and PLDB. A noteworthy point is that the most frequently 
used adjective of this category, i.e. bârâni has a lower frequency of occurrence in the two cor-
puses than the least frequently used adjective of the <modiﬁ cation, property> category, i.e. jâ-
leb, showing that the <modiﬁ cation, object> adjectives are to be regarded more peripheral ad-
jectives than the <modiﬁ cation, property> adjectives in terms of frequency of occurrence. Now, 
we investigate prototypicality of the <modiﬁ cation, action> adjectives.
4.3. The <modiﬁ cation, action> adjectives
Although this type of adjectives modify nouns, they denote actions rather than properties. 
The adjectives of this group are derived from verbs. They are present and past participles which 
are referred to as subject and object adjectives respectively in the traditional Persian grammar. 
An important point worth noting is that the <modiﬁ cation, action> adjectives lend themselves 
more easily than other types of adjectives to category shift; that is, there are many more nomi-
nalization cases of the <modiﬁ cation, action> adjectives than other types of adjectives in Persian. 
For example, nominals such as nevisande ‘writer’, xaridâr ‘buyer’, forušande ‘salesperson’, and 
jangande ‘warrior’ have originally been adjectives, but are only rarely used adjectivally in con-
temporary Persian. Now, we examine the prototypicality of the <modiﬁ cation, action> adjec-
tives based on the criteria of TPT.
116 
Voprosy Jazykoznanija

4.3.1. Structural coding
Since the  <modiﬁ cation, action> adjectives are derived from verbs by the addition of an ad-
jective-making suﬃ  x, they can be said to be structurally coded adjectives. These adjectives are 
thus to be considered peripheral or non-prototypical adjectives in terms of structural coding.
4.3.2. Behavioral potential
This criterion is related to the behavior or usage of prototypical adjectives. It has three sub-cri-
teria, namely gradability, attributive and predicative uses, and frequency of occurrence.
Gradability. The <modiﬁ cation, action> adjectives, in their unmarked usages, are only rarely 
used comparatively or superlatively:
(12) *qazâ-ye   poxte-tar
food-��      cooked-���
‘more cooked food’
However, the <modiﬁ cation, action> adjectives, like other types of adjectives, also have 
extended usages, which may make us categorize them as other types of adjectives. For exam-
ple, poxte is also used in Persian to modify a person rather than food in the sense of ‘experi-
enced’, or ‘well-rounded’, in which case it is to be categorized as a <modiﬁ cation, property> 
adjective. This is the very reason why it lends itself to comparative or superlative positions 
as easily as do other <modiﬁ cation, property> adjectives. This is indeed the non-inherent 
use of this word, just as the use of the word šekanande ‘fragile’ in the following sentence 
from the corpus:
(13) ma   borukrasi-ye    besyâr   šekanande-yi   dâr-im.
we    bureaucracy-��   very      fragile-����      have-���.1��
‘We have a very easily-aﬀ ected bureaucracy.’
In (13), the adjective šekanande, which is morphologically a present participle, is used 
in an extended, non-inherent, or, more precisely, metaphorical sense — as a “property” rather 
than “action” adjective. This is why it can be modiﬁ ed by an intensifying adverb. We can come 
to the conclusion that prototypicality is a context-dependent phenomenon and words should 
not be evaluated in terms of prototypicality independently from the contexts where they appear. 
However, we may say that the <modiﬁ cation, action> adjectives are actually used in compar-
ative or superlative forms less frequently than those of the type <modiﬁ cation, property>, and 
the very few comparative uses of such adjectives can be accounted for by the fact that they have 
come to denote property rather than action, a phenomenon which can be referred to as demar-
cation and can be said to comply well with the so-called fuzzy theory, which is one of the ma-
jor principles of TPT.
Attributive and predicative functions. The following sentences from the corpora suggest 
that <modiﬁ cation, action> adjectives are used in both attributive and predicative positions:
(14) …ke    yak-i     az   čand   xatari    ast
which   one-����   of    few    danger    be.���.3��
 
ke    solh-e    šekanande   dar   Kabol   râ   tahdid   mi-kon-ad
that   peace-��   fragile        in     Kabul    ���   threat     ����-do-���.3��
‘…which is one of the few dangers that threaten the unstable peace in Kabul.’
(15) in    nazarieh   az    didgâh-e   qoumšenâsi   šekanande   be   nazar   mi-res-ad.
this   theory      from  view-��     ethnology      fragile        to    view    ����-reach-���.3��
‘This seems not to be a strong theory from the perspective of ethnology.’
 
 Amin Karimi, Vali Rezai 
117
To summarize, the adjectives of this category have the same behavior with respect to all 
of the criteria of TPT except for the sub-criterion of gradability. Some of these adjectives are 
presented in the following table:

As the table above shows, these <modiﬁ cation, action> adjectives are used in attributive and 
predicative positions, but they are structurally coded words. On the other hand, some of them 
are gradable, while others are not. What we can conclude is that this type of adjectives cannot 
be considered prototypical based on structural coding and gradability criteria. Now we will see 
whether the sub-criterion of frequency conﬁ rms this conclusion or not.
Frequency of occurrence. According to the data of PLDB and Bijankhan Corpus, adjectives 
of this class have a very low frequency of use. The ﬁ ve adjectives of this category presented 
in Table 5 are just a few examples representing these low-frequency adjectives. We also exam-
ined their comparative forms in order to conﬁ rm the gradability criterion.

These data conﬁ rm that these adjectives are peripheral, or non-prototypical. However, in the 
case of šekanande, which occurs with a higher frequency than the other adjectives of this cate-
gory, we may say that this adjective has come to be used in an extended and metaphorical sense 
to denote a human state or property (as a <modiﬁ cation, property> adjective), which accounts 
for its high frequency.
To sum up, we can say that the <modiﬁ cation, action> adjectives do not meet at least two cri-
teria of TPT. However, not all members of this category are equally non-prototypical, meaning 
118

that their prototypicality can be regarded as a continuum. The following graph shows the fre-
quency of occurrence of the <modiﬁ cation, action> adjectives in the corpora.

The above graph shows that the examined adjectives have a low frequency of occurrence both 
in Bijankhan Corpus and in PLDB, with šekastani and šekanande at the two extremes of the 
continuum. A noteworthy point is that the most frequently used adjective of this category, i.e. 
šekanande, has a lower frequency in the two corpora than the least frequently used adjective 
of the <modiﬁ cation, property> category, showing that the <modiﬁ cation, action> adjectives 
are not as prototypical as the <modiﬁ cation, property> adjectives in this respect. To have a more 
illustrative view of prototypical and non-prototypical adjectives, let us compare all three types 
based on the criteria and sub-criteria of TPT.
4.4. A comparison of the prototypicality 
of property, object and action adjectives
To compare the prototypicality degree of all types of adjectives, we have used all of the cri-
teria and sub-criteria of TPT, except for the sub-criterion “attributive and predicative use”, be-
cause all types of adjectives are used both attributively and predicatively and this sub-criterion 
is thus redundant. The following graph (p. 119) summarizes the comparison of 15 adjectives se-
lected from three adjective categories based on structural coding and gradability.
This graph shows that the <modiﬁ cation, property> adjectives are prototypical in terms of both 
structural coding and gradability. However, the <modiﬁ cation, action> adjectives are structur-
ally coded and some of them are not gradable. They are, therefore, peripheral, or non-prototyp-
ical. The third group, the <modiﬁ cation, object> adjectives are non-prototypical in terms of both 
structural coding and gradability. To sum up, we can show the prototypicality degree of these 
three types of adjectives along a continuum in the following way:
Prototypical adjectives 
 Non-prototypical adjectives
Property       Action         Object
This means that property adjectives are more prototypical than action and object adjectives, 
and that object adjectives are more peripheral than action adjectives. Now we will see whether 
the frequency data are in line with this result.

Next graph (Figure 5) shows that the <modiﬁ cation, property> adjectives are also more 
frequently used than the other two types, and are therefore closer to prototypical adjectives. 
However, not all lexemes are equally prototypical, because prototypicality is basically a mat-
ter of degree.
One of the major shortcomings of TPT is that it does not provide us with suﬃ  cient criteria 
to enable comparing diﬀ erent adjectives in terms of prototypicality. In other words, the criteria 
that we can extract from this theory for diﬀ erentiating between prototypical and peripheral ad-
jectives are not comprehensive enough to be applied to all members of diﬀ erent parts of speech 
and to lead us to reliable results. It seems that TPT has assigned too many aspects of language 
to parameters, which has led to the widened scope of parameters and the limited scope of prin-
ciples. This is the very reason why researchers of speciﬁ c languages cannot limit themselves 
to the criteria proposed by TPT in their research. In other words, as people all over the world 
have many similarities in their behavior, it is not unlikely to have many common features appli-
cable to all languages of the world.
Now the question arises as to how to distinguish the class of adjectives from other parts 
of speech (nouns and adverbs). As we know, an adjective describes a noun or pronoun, while 
an adverb describes a verb or anything apart from a noun and pronoun. However, many Persian 
words such as tond ‘fast’, xub ‘good/well’, and zibâ ‘beautiful/beautifully’ are used both adjec-
tivally and adverbially:
(16) Ali   rânande-ye   xub-i      ast.
Ali   driver-��       good-����   be.���.3��
‘Ali is a good (adj.) driver.’
(17) Ali   xub   rânandegi   mi-kon-ad.
Ali   well   driving       ����-do-���.3��
‘Ali drives well (adv.).’
It is the context (the type of verb) that helps us distinguish the part of speech of such words, 
although adverbs are also made up of a preposition + adjective (+ the suﬃ  x -i), e.g. be xub-i 
‘well’, be tond-i ‘fast’, be zibâ-yi ‘beautifully’, in which case such a construction helps us to de-
termine their part of speech. The same problem exists in the case of words functioning as both 
adjectives and nouns. For instance, bozorg ‘big’, which is originally an adjective, may come

adjectives in terms of frequency of occurrence
to be used nominally as well, but morphological markers such as suﬃ  xes help us to determine 
their part of speech. For example, bozorg-ân ‘great people’ has taken the plural noun suﬃ  x -ân, 
whereas, if it takes the comparative suﬃ  x -tar, it is certainly an adjective rather than a noun. 
However, if such ﬂ exible words are not accompanied by such distinguishing suﬃ  xes, the ezafe 
particle may help us to determine their lexical categories:
 
 Amin Karimi, Vali Rezai 
121
(18) pedar-e   Rezâ   mard-e   bozorg-i   ast.
father-��   Reza   man-��    great-����   be.���.3��
‘Reza’s father is a great man.’
In this sentence, bozorg does not take the ezafe particle, so it is an adjective. However, this 
word takes that particle in the following sentence and is used nominally rather than adjectivally:
(19) pedar-e   Reza   bozorg-e   šahr   ast.
father-��   Reza   great-��    city    be.���.3��
‘Reza’s father is the great man of the city.’
Therefore, in addition to the context (type of verb), morphological evidence such as suﬃ  xes 
and the ezafe particle marks the class of such ﬂ exible words.
5. Conclusion and discussion
This study investigated the lexical category of adjectives in Persian within the framework 
of TPT. One of important aims of this study was to evaluate TPT in determining the prototyp-
ical features of Persian adjectives. Having collected the data from two corpora and analyzed 
them with respect to the criteria and sub-criteria of TPT, we came to the conclusion that TPT 
can partly help to determine and deﬁ ne prototypical and atypical adjectives in Persian, but it 
has certain shortcomings in this respect due to the insuﬃ  cient set of criteria and sub-criteria 
proposed for this purpose. In other words, although this theory has proposed two major cri-
teria for prototypicality of adjectives, these criteria are not comprehensive enough to deter-
mine the prototypicality degree of diﬀ erent adjectives within the same category. These cri-
teria could have more sub-criteria concerning diﬀ erent morphological, syntactic, semantic, 
and pragmatic behavior such that they could help us determine the prototypicality degree 
of diﬀ erent members of a category. More speciﬁ cally, TPT could prove more helpful in dis-
tinguishing between prototypical and non-prototypical words if it considered the monosemy 
and polysemy phenomena, more various syntactic functions of POS, morphological features 
like derivation, and class range.
The present study also aimed to account for the morphological and syntactic diﬀ erences be-
tween prototypical and non-prototypical adjectives in Persian. Having tested diﬀ erent types 
of adjectives using the two criteria proposed within the theoretical framework of the research, 
we came to the conclusion that prototypical adjectives, unlike peripheral or non-prototypical 
ones, are structurally unmarked, lend themselves to comparative and superlative forms more 
easily, and are used both attributively and predicatively. In addition, having investigated the as-
sociation between frequency of occurrence and prototypicality of adjectives in Persian by using 
PLDB and Bijankhan Corpus, we concluded that those adjectives which are regarded by TPT 
as prototypical are also used more frequently in the mentioned corpora.
One of the main questions which the present paper sought to answer was about the degree 
to which the sub-classes of adjectives in traditional Persian grammar such as descriptive, re-
lational, ability, subjective and objective adjectives are associated with prototypical adjectives 
in this language. Therefore, one of the hypotheses of this research was that there is a relation-
ship between the traditionally categorized adjective types in Persian and their degree of proto-
typicality. It was shown that such relationship exists, in such a way that property adjectives are 
the most prototypical and object adjectives are the least prototypical , while the action adjec-
tives are in between them on the prototypicality continuum. The so-called descriptive adjectives 
all belong to the <modiﬁ cation, property> category and are thus prototypical. However, the so-
called relational adjectives all belong to the <modiﬁ cation, object> category and are thus periph-
eral, or non-prototypical. The rest of the traditional categories, including the so-called subjective, 
122 
Voprosy Jazykoznanija 
2020. № 2
objective and ability adjectives are all to be regarded in their unmarked usages as <modiﬁ cation, 
action> adjectives and are thus also peripheral.
However, it was shown in this study that due to diﬀ erent inherent and non-inherent senses, the 
same adjective may simultaneously belong to more than one category depending on the context 
in which it appears. In other words, a speciﬁ c (metaphorical) sense of a given word may exclude 
that word from its common and unmarked category and cause it to take the features of another 
category. This is why we cannot determine the extent to which an adjective, apart from its con-
text, is prototypical. In addition to the demarcation phenomenon, speakers sometimes recatego-
rize a word into another part of speech, the phenomenon known as category shift. This is why 
we can talk of processes such as adjectivalization, deadjectivalization, nominalization, denom-
inalization, verbalization, deverbalization, and so on in languages. The present paper provided 
examples of nominalization in Persian, but each of these processes could be used as a future re-
search topic in a particular language.
