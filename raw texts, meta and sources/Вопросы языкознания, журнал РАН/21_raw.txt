Resolving scope ambiguity: 
Lexicon, pragmatics, information structure

Abstract: This paper presents a corpus study of factors involved in disambiguating potentially ambigu-
ous sentences with negation and universal quantiﬁ er all in written English, such as I haven’t heard all 
these details. Ambiguity in such sentences results from potential diﬀ erences in scope assignment. If 
negation scopes over the quantiﬁ er, we get the interpreta tion of partial negation: ‘I have heard some 
of these details’. If negation scopes over the verb, we get the interpretation of total negation: ‘I hav-
en’t heard any of these details’.
While there is abundant research on the phenomenon of scope ambiguity and its disambiguation 
via prosody, syntax and semantics, less is known about the pragmatic mechanisms that allow speak-
ers to infer intended scope readings from the lexical environment in actual texts. In order to study the 
correlation between the lexical set-up of not + Verb + all sentences, their pragmatically plausible inter-
pretations, their information structure, and their scope readings in actual usage, we analyze about 1500 
sentences extracted from EnTenTen15 Corpus and the Corpus of Contemporary American. Our study 
demonstrates that diﬀ erent lexical instantiations of this construction are associated with diﬀ erent prag-
matic scenarios and, hence, with diﬀ erent information structures and scope readings.
The interpretations of partial negation (quantiﬁ er negation) and total negation (verb negation) dif-
fer with respect to semantics, pragmatics and information structure. Namely, a focused quantiﬁ er pro-
duces partial negation, while a focused verb produces total negation. Quantiﬁ er negation entails literal 
interpretation of the quantiﬁ er all in its direct quantiﬁ cational meaning (I haven’t talked to [all] my stu-
dents); verb negation mostly entails emphatic interpretation of all in its meaning of negative emphasis 
(I don’t [want] to talk to all these idiots).
Quantiﬁ er negation is considerably more frequent than verb negation due to its pragmatic neutrality. 
In the absence of verb negation markers, it is the default interpretation of V not all structures. Because 
of its association with quantiﬁ cation, quantiﬁ er negation frequently occurs in the context of predicates 
that take a quantiﬁ cational argument as a direct object (to include, to list, to ﬁ nish), or easily allow quan-
tiﬁ able or multiple objects (to know, to meet requirements, to answer criteria). Such predicates are con-
ducive both to placing the quantiﬁ er in the focus and interpreting it in its literal quantiﬁ cational mean-
ing: He didn’t list [all] the requirements; The candidate doesn’t answer [all] the criteria. Verb negation 
usually occurs with temporal modiﬁ ers containing all (such as all night) because they are conducive 
to placing the verb in the focus: I haven’t [slept] all night. Verb negation also occurs with emphatic de-
monstratives and negatively connoted lexical items because they consolidate the emphatic interpreta-
tion of the quantiﬁ er all: I don’t [want] to hear all these disgusting details.

Разрешение неоднозначных сфер действия: 
лексика, прагматика, коммуникативная структура

Аннотация: В статье представлено корпусное исследование факторов, связанных с разрешением не-
однозначности потенциально двусмысленных предложений с отрицанием и квантором всеобщно-
сти в письменном английском языке, таких как I haven’t heard all these details. Неопределенность 
в таких предложениях проистекает из потенциальных различий в сфере действия. Если отрица-
ние включает в свою сферу действия квантор, мы получаем интерпретацию частичного отрица-
ния: ‘Я слышал некоторые из этих деталей’. Если отрицание включает в свою сферу действия 
глагол, мы получаем интерпретацию полного отрицания: ‘Я не слышал ни одной из этих деталей’.
Хотя неоднозначность сфер действия в предложениях с отрицанием и квантором всеобщно-
сти, а также механизмы ее разрешения с помощью просодии, синтаксиса и семантики достаточно 
хорошо изучены, о прагматических механизмах, позволяющих говорящим интерпретировать по-
тенциально двусмысленные предложения, известно намного меньше. Чтобы изучить корреляцию 
между лексической реализацией предложений вида not + Verb + all, их прагматически правдо-
подобными интерпретациями и их коммуникативной структурой, мы анализируем около 1500 
предложений, извлеченных из корпуса EnTenTen15 и Корпуса современного американского языка. 
Наше исследование демонстрирует, что различные лексические реализации этой конструкции 
связаны с различными прагматическими сценариями и, следовательно, с различными коммуни-
кативными структурами и различными интерпретациями сфер действия.
Отрицание квантора встречается значительно чаще, чем отрицание глагола, из-за его праг-
матической нейтральности. В отсутствие маркеров отрицания, по умолчанию структуры вида 
not V all X интерпретируются с частичным отрицанием. Поскольку при отрицании квантора он 
имеет количественную (а не эмфатическую) интерпретацию, контексты частичного отрицания 
тяготеют к особому семантическому классу предикатов — а именно, к глаголам, которые при-
нимают количественный аргумент в качестве прямого объекта (to include, to list, to ﬁ nish). Такие 
предикаты способствуют как помещению квантора в фокус, так и его интерпретации в букваль-
ном количественном значении: He didn’t list [all] the requirements; The candidate doesn’t answer 
[all] the criteria. Глагол обычно попадает под отрицание в контексте временны́ х модификаторов, 
содержащих квантор all (например, all night), потому что они способствуют помещению глагола 
в фокус: I haven’t [slept] all night. Отрицание глагола также встречается с указательными место-
имениями в эмфатической функции, поскольку они консолидируют эмфатическую (а не коли-
чественную) интерпретацию всей именной группы с квантором: I don’t [want] to hear all these 
disgusting details.
Ключевые слова: кванторные местоимения, коммуникативная структура, отрицание, прагматика, 
семантика, сфера действия

1. Introduction
This paper considers the correlation between lexicon, pragmatics and information structure 
in the interpretation of scope ambiguities in English sentences with predicate negation1 and uni-
versal quantiﬁ er, such as
(1) 
I haven’t talked to all these students.
Negation can scope either over the universal quantiﬁ er, producing the interpretation of par-
tial negation ‘I have talked only to part of these students’, or over the verb, producing the inter-
pretation of total negation ‘I haven’t talked to any of these students’. The scope of negation is 
decided on the basis of information structure, as demonstrated by [Jackendoﬀ  1972: 248–273]; 
namely, the operator (in this case, negation) scopes over the ����� of the utterance. Scope am-
biguities are a well-studied area of linguistics; consider [Jespersen 1924; Klima 1964; Hintikka 
1973; Cooper 1979; Gil 1982; Aoun, Li 1989; Horn 1989; Partee 1993; Reinhart 1997; Kiss 2006], 
to mention just a few seminal works. There is also plentiful research on the role of information 
structure in determining scope [Jackendoﬀ  1972; Sgall et al. 1973; Partee 1991; Hajičova 1998]. 
Many recent experimental studies on scope disambiguation examine the role of prosody in the 
detection of the intended scope reading and its ties with information structure [Kadmon, Rob-
erts 1986; Koizumi 2009; Ionin 2010; Syrett et al. 2014]. Other research on disambiguation fo-
cuses on syntactic clues [Kurtzman, MacDonald 1993]; on respective probabilities of possible 
readings [Hurum 1988]; on general structural and semantic principles of scope disambiguation, 
such as “economic stance” [Tunstall 1998].
While the role of information structure in scope disambiguation is paramount, we suggest that 
in written text, where prosodic information is unavailable, information structure is ultimately 
inferred via pragmatic reasoning. Pragmatically diﬀ erent situations are associated with diﬀ er-
ent lexical environment. Thus, the objective of this research is to ﬁ nd correlations between the 
lexical ﬁ lling of not + Verb + all strings and standard pragmatic scenarios associated with each 
lexicalization pattern, on the one hand, and typical information structures and scope readings, 
on the other.
2. Hypothesis and approach
Our approach in this paper is based on some of the claims and results presented in [V. Apres-
jan 2019], mainly relative to the Russian data.
Namely, we assume that diﬀ erent information structures of not + Verb + all sentences, which 
result in diﬀ erent scope readings of negation, are associated with diﬀ erent kinds of pragmatic 
scenarios and, therefore, with diﬀ erent lexical expression. Thus, lexical environment can be 
used as a clue to infer the intended scope readings. We expect to demonstrate that the two ma-
jor scope readings of negation in not + Verb + all sentences, namely, negated quantiﬁ er read-
ing and negated verb reading, possess their own distinct lexical markers. Certain pragmatically 
plausible readings are to a large extent lexicalized.
We aspire to study the typical collocational patterns of not + Verb + all sentences and demon-
strate that they are associated with particular pragmatic scenarios and, hence, with speciﬁ c in-
formation structures and scope readings.
 
1 Following [Paducheva 1974], we use this term in its syntactic sense, namely, to describe negation that 
is syntactically attached to the predicate (but semantically can have scope over other constituents in the 
sentence).

3. Methods and materials
The study is based on samples extracted from Corpus of Contemporary American [COCA], 
which is a balanced 560-million-token corpus spanning 1990–2015, and [EnTenTen15] Corpus 
on Sketch Engine, which is a 19-billion-token Web-based corpus, crawled and processed during 
the last ten years. Our main samples used to analyze the distribution of readings and identify 
their contextual markers include 200 examples from each corpus.2 They have been randomly 
selected from the results of the search query not + Verb + all, after manually excluding all irrel-
evant contexts. Irrelevant contexts included:
 
— idiomatic constructions, such as He isn’t all that smart;
 
— clauses with factive predicates which allow only verb-negated readings because the em-
bedded proposition is presupposed, such as I didn’t know all the students were late;
 
— clauses with non-factive predicates which allow only quantiﬁ er-negated readings, because 
the embedded proposition is asserted, such as I didn’t think all the students were late;
 
— rhetoric questions and unreal conditionals which presuppose the truthfulness of the ne-
gated proposition, such as Haven’t I said all this before?, If he hadn’t spent all the money 
gambling, he’d have bought himself a new suit.
Our search query does not include sentences of all + Noun + Verb + not structure, with the 
quantiﬁ er all in the subject.3 In principle, this string allows both quantiﬁ er-negated (Q-negated) 
and verb-negated (V-negated) interpretations:
(2) 
[All] men are not created equal.
‘Not all men are created equal.’
(3) 
At examination, all monkeys had not [undergone] any intervention and had not been in-
volved in any study.
‘None of the monkeys had undergone any intervention.’
However, both for verb negation and for quantiﬁ er negation, this construction is considerably 
less frequent than alternative ways of expression. Partial negation of subjects with all is more 
frequently expressed by strings not + all + Noun + Verb (a rare case when constituent nega-
tion is preferred over sentential negation in English). The frequency of not + all + Noun + Verb 
strings is almost 5 times as high the frequency of all + Noun + Verb + not strings (3.88 ipm 
vs. 0.82 ipm in EnTenTen15). Total negation in English is normally expressed by negative pro-
nouns: None of the students came, but not All students didn’t come.
First, we annotate our two samples for scope. Next, we formulate contextual markers for 
verb-negated and quantiﬁ er-negated readings. Then we verify the validity of our contexts 
as markers of speciﬁ c readings by extracting samples with these markers from COCA and from 
EnTenTen15 and analyzing them for scope. We also rely on frequency data from both corpora 
to verify our claims.
 
2 We extracted a diﬀ erent sample from COCA than the one used in [V. Apresjan 2019], using an enhanced 
manual extraction procedure that excluded irrelevant contexts; although the distribution of readings is 
similar, the actual numbers are slightly diﬀ erent. We have also included a sample from the EnTenTen15 
corpus, which we did not consider in earlier work.
 
3 Tottie and Neukom-Hermann [2010] present a corpus analysis of all N not V sentences and suggest that 
their interpretation is decided mostly by syntactic factors.

4. Results and discussion
4.1. Interpretations of sentences with predicate negation
In our samples, we encounter four types of scope readings: Q-negated readings, or sentences 
where the negation scopes over the quantiﬁ er; V-negated readings, or sentences where negation 
scopes over the verb; C-negated readings, or sentences where negation scopes over a diﬀ erent 
constituent; A-readings, or ambiguous readings.
In Q-negated readings, the negation scopes over the quantiﬁ er, which is in the focus:
(4) 
I haven’t read [all] the instructions. [EnTenTen15]
The quantiﬁ er is interpreted in its direct quantiﬁ cational meaning. The resulting interpreta-
tion is that of partial negation: ‘not all X Y’. Thus, Q-negated reading of the structure not Y [all] 
X-s is normally interpreted as ‘Some X-s Y and some X-s not Y’. If the quantiﬁ er is stressed and 
thus forms a single focus, the aﬃ  rmative component ‘some X-s Y’ has the status of a presup-
position and cannot be denied:
(5) 
a. I haven’t read [���] the instructions, I have read only part.
 
b. *I haven’t read [���] the instructions; in fact, I haven’t read any.
In this respect, Q-negated readings of sentences with sentential negation are the same as sen-
tences with constituent negation of the universal quantiﬁ er:
(6) 
*Not all guests came; in fact, none did.
If the quantiﬁ er is unstressed and thus is part of the focus, the component ‘some X-s Y’ has 
the status of a scalar implicature and can be denied:
(7) 
a. The students don’t realize [all] the opportunities they have to go out and do things. [En-
TenTen15]
 
b. The students don’t realize [all] the opportunities they have to go out and do things; 
in fact, they realize nothing.
In V-negated readings, the negation scopes over the verb, which is in the focus:
(8) 
People just get along with their business, work hard, and they’re not [causing] all sorts 
of trouble. [COCA]
(9) 
We can do the same, not [accepting] all the religious ideas that swirl around but not con-
demning them either. [EnTenTen15]
The resulting interpretation is that of total negation: ‘all X not Y’. In V-negated readings, the 
quantiﬁ er is frequently interpreted not in its direct quantiﬁ cational meaning, but as a marker 
of negative emphasis:
(10) We will not have all these little houses, we must all get big houses, man. [COCA]
When all is interpreted emphatically, it can be dropped without signiﬁ cant changes in seman-
tics: We will not have (these) little houses, we must all get big houses.
Ambiguous readings are contextually underspeciﬁ ed sentences, which are felicitous either 
with partial or total negation, as in (11) 4:
(11) Thank you for not counting all of my sins against me. [EnTenTen15]
 
4 As demonstrated below, they are fairly rare.
12 
Voprosy Jazykoznanija

(11) can mean either ‘Thank you for counting only part of my sins against me and overlook-
ing others’ (Q-negation) or ‘Thank you for not counting any of my great many sins against me’ 
(V-negation). With Q-negation, all is neutral and refers only to the quantity of sins (which can be 
modest). With V-negation, all is emphatic and expresses quantitative and qualitative assessment 
of the sins — they are both numerous and great. In case of (11), the utterance does not contain 
the necessary clues, and a wider context is required for interpretation. Possible interpretations 
are built based on reconstructing the potential intention of the speaker.
However, in the majority of cases this intention is clear from the utterance; consider (12) vs. (13):
(12) Social Security does not count all your resources when deciding SSI [supplemental secu-
rity income] eligibility. ([EnTenTen15]; Q-negation)
(13) This doesn’t count all the people who never showed up for meetings. ([EnTenTen15]; V-ne-
gation)
In (12), it is plausible that deciding social beneﬁ ts eligibility includes at least some assess-
ment of a person’s resources, so Q-negation is the preferred option. Sentence (13) makes more 
sense with V-negation: it is more logical to exclude the non-attendees from general count alto-
gether, rather than exclude only part of them on some obscure grounds.
In C-negated readings, the negation scopes over some other focused component in the sentence:
(14) Young people cannot do all those things [at 16].
‘Young people can do all those things but not at 16.’
4.2. Distribution of readings and contexts
Our 200-sentence EnTenTen15 and COCA samples demonstrate a similar distribution of read-
ings (Tables 1 and 2) and their lexical environments. As one can easily observe, the overwhelm-
ing majority of sentences in our sample is interpreted with Q-negation; a much smaller number 
of sentences receives V-negated readings; ambiguity and especially C-negation are rare. The 
types of lexical contexts and their motivation by diﬀ erent scope readings are explained below.
On the whole, lexical markers of Q-negation and V-negation are determined by the semantic 
and pragmatic peculiarities of these readings, namely (i) partial or total negation and (ii) quan-
tiﬁ cational or emphatic interpretation of the quantiﬁ er. The interpretation of partial or total ne-
gation is triggered by the information structure of the sentence: quantiﬁ er in the focus for par-
tial negation, verb in the focus for total negation.

4.3. Quantiﬁ er-negated readings: contextual markers
Lexical markers of Q-negation are triggered by the following two factors: in Q-negated read-
ings, (i) the quantiﬁ er is in the focus; (ii) the quantiﬁ er is interpreted in its quantiﬁ cational meaning.
As concerns (i), we observe correlation between the scope interpretation of predicate nega-
tion and the status of the quantiﬁ cational group with all in the argument structure of the ma-
trix predicate. Namely, the interpretation of partial negation is normally available for predicates 
where the quantiﬁ cational group ﬁ lls a verbal argument, rather than an adjunct. Indeed, in the 
absolute majority of Q-negated sentences, the quantiﬁ er phrase ﬁ lls a verbal argument: We ha-
ven’t watched all Tarantino movies, He hasn’t answered all the questions, I don’t need all the 
money, The candidate doesn’t meet all the requirements.
As for semantic classes of predicates that occur with Q-negation, they are determined by the 
quantitative, non-emphatic interpretation of all. Q-negation frequently occurs with predicates 
that contain an indication or implication of quantity, such as to include, to ﬁ nish, to cover (for 
details, see below). Yet another class of words that mark Q-negation are numerals, which also 
consolidate the quantitative interpretation of all.
4.3.1. Num erals as markers of quantiﬁ er-negated readings
In our combined sample, there are 8 numerals, which all occur with Q-negation, consider:
(15) XM will not broadcast [all] 64 matches in English and Spanish. [COCA]
(16) The animal cannot synthesize [all] 20 amino acids. [COCA]
(17) The images did not reveal [all] four chambers. [COCA]
To verify the validity of numerals as markers of Q-negation, we further analyze a sam-
ple of 100 randomly selected sentences from EnTenTen15 Corpus that contain the string 
not + Verb + all + Numeral, such as She can’t help all 20 million children in Africa; The med-
ical insurance does not cover all three components.
Out of 100 sentences with a numeral in the quantiﬁ er phrase, 89 sentences are interpreted 
with Q-negation. They demonstrate certain repeated lexical patterns that reﬂ ect typical real-life 
situations, mainly the situations of possession, need, being part of a certain group, meeting re-
quirements and demands: You cannot have all four options at the same time; The applicant does 
not meet all ﬁ ve requirements; The insurance does not cover all eight tests; The agreement does 
not include all three parties; I do not need all ten participants on each project; He didn’t an-
swer all ten questions.
Eight sentences in our sample are “noise”, where the numeral does not function as a numeral, 
such as They can’t be all one-sided; One cannot practice all one knows. Only three sentences 
have alternative, not Q-negated, interpretations:
(18) If we don’t [receive all three requirements], we cannot guarantee your slot.
‘If we receive less than three requirements, we cannot guarantee your slot.’
(19) Why not [use all three]?
‘I suggest to use all three.’
(20) There is tons to do and see throughout the county, so don’t [miss] all three regions.
‘Miss none of the three regions.’
In (18), negation scopes over the entire proposition. Namely, the proposition in the main 
clause (We cannot guarantee your slot) is true in either case, whether we do not receive any 
of the three requirements (verb-negated reading, total negation) or we receive only some of the 
 
 Valentina Yu. Apresjan 
15
three requirements (quantiﬁ er-negated reading, partial negation). The diﬀ erence between total 
negation and partial negation in this case is immaterial.
In (19), the negative particle not is part of the syntactic phraseme why not. This idiomatic 
construction is an indirect speech act: it introduces a recommendation in the form of a question, 
namely, the speaker suggests that the addressee carries out the action expressed by the proposi-
tion. Why not construction scopes over the entire proposition.
Finally, (20) is naturally interpreted with a verb-negated reading: the speaker recommends 
not to miss ��� of the three regions. Thus, out of 92 relevant sentences, 89 are interpreted with 
quantiﬁ er negation. Therefore, numerals can indeed be considered a strong marker of quantiﬁ er- 
negated readings in English.
4.3.2. Predicates that refer to quantity as markers of quantiﬁ er-negated reading
Another marker of quantiﬁ er-negated readings are predicates with a quantitative argument, 
such as to include, to contain; to complete, to ﬁ nish; to exhaust; to cover, to absorb; to share; 
to itemize, to list and some others. When used with negation and a quantiﬁ er phrase to ﬁ ll their 
object argument slot, they naturally produce quantiﬁ er-negated readings. Consider the follow-
ing examples:
(21) The Archives Hub does not include [all] UK archives. [COCA]
‘The Archives Hub includes only part of the UK archives.’
(22) Five students did not complete [all] EPQ items. [COCA]
‘Five students completed only part of EPQ items.’
(23) We cannot [list] all the tracks now. [EnTenTen15]
‘We can list only some of the tracks now.’
(24) This information is of a general character and does not [contain] all the conditions under 
which passenger transport is implemented by Slovak airline companies. [EnTenTen15]
‘This information contains only part of the conditions.’
All these verbs contain a semantic indication of quantiﬁ cation, at least on some level of se-
mantic decomposition. Consider the deﬁ nition of to include in the Online Macmillan Dictio-
nary: ‘to contain someone or something as a part’. The sense ‘part’ is quantitative, as attested 
by the deﬁ nition of this word in the same dictionary: ‘some but not all of something’. Thus, the 
verb to include contains the meaning of quantiﬁ cation on the second level of semantic decom-
position. The same is true of to contain which is deﬁ ned, somewhat circularly, as ‘to include 
something, or to have it as a part’. Likewise, the verb to complete means ‘to ﬁ nish something’, 
to ﬁ nish means ‘to do the last part of something’, and part means, as said before, ‘some but not 
all of something’. Therefore, the verb to complete contains the meaning of quantiﬁ cation on the 
third level of semantic decomposition. The verb to list means ‘to mention or write a list of things, 
one after another’, whereas the noun list refers to ‘a set of names, numbers etc. that are written 
or printed one below another’. The word set refers to a certain ������ of elements that form 
a group together. Again, to list contains the meaning of quantiﬁ cation on the third level of se-
mantic decomposition. The verb to share contains quantiﬁ cation on the ﬁ rst level of semantic 
decomposition: it means ‘to give a part of what one has to another person’.
All verbs with a quantiﬁ cational argument in our sample belong to the following semantic 
classes: (i) ‘to have as a part’ (to contain, to include); (ii) ‘to put elements of a set in order’ (to list, 
to itemize); (iii) ‘to do something gradually with all elements of a set or all parts of an object’ 
(to ﬁ nish, to complete, to cover, to absorb); (iv) ‘to do something with some elements of a set 
or some parts of an object’ (to share). They form a considerable chunk of our sample (59 hits 
in EnTenTen15 and 20 hits in COCA), and they are strong predictors of Q-negated readings.

4.3.3. Predicates that frequently involve quantity 
as markers of quantiﬁ er-negated readings
More frequently, quantity is a plausible extention of the meaning, rather than a semantic com-
ponent. Consider the example in (25):
(25) Current contraceptive technology does not meet [all] of the National Park Service’s cri-
teria. [COCA]
‘Current technology meets part of the criteria.’
Indeed, meeting criteria usually implies more than one criterion, and the criteria are consid-
ered separately, one by one. Meeting criteria belongs to the semantic class of predicates that we 
labeled ‘needs’. This class includes verbs that refer to situations of requirements, expectations, 
needs, and is represented by the verbs to answer (expectations, needs, requirements), to fulﬁ ll 
(needs), to provide, to address (needs), to meet (expectations, criteria, requirements), to sat-
isfy (requirements), to solve (all problems) and some others. The argument ﬁ lling the object 
slot in these verbs is usually quantiﬁ ed (all needs, some requirements, ﬁ ve criteria) because the 
situations described by these verbs normally involve sets consisting of more than one element. 
This semantic class is fairly frequent in our sample (42 hits in EnTenTen15, 38 hits in COCA) 
and is a strong predictor of Q-negated readings.
Other semantic classes of predicates that imply quantity while not referring to it directly, and 
that frequently occur in sentences with partial negation in our COCA sample are as follows:
 
— verbs of possession and acquisition, especially to have, to possess, to get;
 
— mental verbs, especially to know, to understand;
 
— verbs of perception, especially to see, to hear.
While verbs belonging to these semantic classes do not refer to quantity directly, they easily 
take quantiﬁ able arguments because they frequently involve quantiﬁ cation: He has three houses; 
He knows many languages; I saw four paintings; He told me several interesting stories. There-
fore, when used with the universal quantiﬁ er and negation, they are likely to be interpreted in the 
sense of partial negation, rather than total negation. Consider the following examples from our 
COCA sample, which are interpreted with quantiﬁ er negation:
(26) They do not know [all] the information. [COCA]
(27) I have not seen [all] these ﬁ gures. [COCA]
Other mental verbs, e.g. understand and realize, have an even closer association with quan-
tiﬁ cation. Understanding, unlike knowing, is not necessarily a state: it can refer to a process 
that is happening in increments: I don’t yet understand everything; There is little I understand 
so far; I am trying to understand; He has so far realized only some of the implications of this 
conﬂ ict. This multi-stage nature of understanding carries an indirect reference to quantity: un-
derstanding is achieved in multiple instalments, and complete understanding is the sum of all 
the pieces of a puzzle. Thus, verbs of understanding also present a natural context for Q-ne-
gated readings, consider:
(28) I still don’t [understand] all the details. [EnTenTen15]
Verbs of perception are yet another semantic class of verbs with quantitative implicatures. 
While the states of seeing or hearing do not, in themselves, involve any quantiﬁ cation, quantity 
is their frequent pragmatic extention. It can be triggered either by the fact that there may be mul-
tiple objects or sounds to be perceived (I haven’t seen all the paintings; I haven’t heard every-
thing she was saying), or else by the fact that complete perception, even of a single object, might 
be hindered (I can’t see the entire tree through this dirty window; I can’t hear everything you are

saying in this noise). In the latter case, the verbs of perception usually occur with modals: I can’t 
see all the icons on this small screen; I was far from the stage, so I couldn’t hear all the questions.
The last frequent context for Q-negation in our sample is the idiom not put all one’s eggs 
in one basket.
4.3.4. The most frequent corpus instantiations
of not + Verb + all construction
Quantiﬁ er-negated readings in the context of predicates that indicate or imply quantity are 
the most frequent instantiations of the not + Verb + all construction, as attested both by COCA 
and EnTenTen15 collocational data. In terms of collostructional approach [Gries, Stefanowitsch 
2004], predicates with quantiﬁ cational meaning or implicatures can be considered collexemes 
of the not + Verb + all construction, or its most frequent lexical ﬁ llers. Table 3 shows the fre-
quency hierarchy of predicates in order of their occurrence in construction with negation and 
universal quantiﬁ er in the EnTenTen corpus, while Table 4 provides the same information for 
COCA. Both charts give the top twenty predicates.

More than half of the predicates in both samples coincide: to know, to include, to ﬁ t, to get, 
to cover, to see, to solve, to need, to meet, to go, to take, to understand, to provide. Also, many 
of the top predicates in both samples belong to the same semantic classes as the ones featuring 
18 
Voprosy Jazykoznanija 
2020. № 2
in the Q-negated readings from our original EnTenTen15 and COCA samples. They include 
verbs with the semantic component of quantiﬁ cation (to include, to spend), as well as verbs with 
quantiﬁ cational implicatures, such as verbs of perception (to see), mental predicates (to know, 
to understand), modal verbs (to need), verbs of possession (to have).
Moreover, nearly all examples with the top frequency predicates are indeed interpreted with 
Q-negation. We analyzed all the examples in the presented frequency table from COCA, namely 
660 sentences with 19 predicates (since the table presents the results for two diﬀ erent forms, get-
ting and get, as two diﬀ erent verbs). Out of 660 sentences, 582 (or 88 percent) have Q-negated 
interpretations. Furthermore, out of the 78 sentences that do not have quantiﬁ er negation, only 
four are more likely to be interpreted with V-negation, and one with C-negation:
(29) I did not [see] all the poison ivy and multiﬂ ora roses. I just saw possibilities. ([COCA]; 
V-negation)
(30) I did not see [all] this back then. ([COCA]; V-negation)
(31) I sure did not [see] all of this terrorism coming. ([COCA]; V-negation)
(32) USAir oﬃ  cials say privately that the public does not [see] all the pressure tactics that the 
airline is applying. ([COCA]; V-negation)
(33) I am not saying all this [because I have the president’s seat]. ([COCA]; C-negation)
The remaining 73 sentences that do not yield quantiﬁ er-negated interpretations, are “noise”. 
There are quite numerous why not constructions (22 hits), as well as some other syntactic and 
lexical idioms, such as to get all that X, as in Don’t get all that excited (10 hits), go all that X, 
as in Don’t go all that defensive (3 hits), all that much (2 hits). Instantiations with the verb to say 
are almost entirely “noise” (36 hits) because in the sample, this verb is only used with depen-
dent that-clauses, which preclude potential ambiguity. Sentences like I am not saying all this is 
true cannot in principle be interpreted with verb negation.
For the majority of predicates, the use in the construction with negation and universal quan-
tiﬁ er is limited to a few speciﬁ c contexts, which conﬁ rms our hypothesis about certain proto-
typical scenarios which incorporate the idea of partial quantity. For some predicates, there are 
no lexical restrictions on the use in this construction.
Table 5 (p. 19) summarizes the interpretations and typical contexts, if there are any, for each 
of the top predicates in this construction.
Table 5 demonstrates that verbs with the semantic component of quantiﬁ cation, as well 
as verbs with quantiﬁ cational implicatures can indeed be considered a reliable contextual 
marker of quantiﬁ er-negated readings, as the overwhelming majority of their instantiations 
in the not + Verb + all construction is interpreted with quantiﬁ er negation. It further shows that 
in many cases, quantiﬁ er-negated readings are lexicalized not only with respect to the predicates, 
but also to their argument expression.
The process of lexicalization is not arbitrary: it is to a certain extent aligned with the meaning 
inherent in quantiﬁ er negation, namely the meaning of partial quantity. Predicates that contain 
an indication of quantity (such as include) or a strong quantiﬁ cational implicature (such as take, 
get, see, understand) in their ﬁ rst or only meaning do not, as a rule, pose lexical restrictions on the 
realization of verbal arguments. Predicates that have one major meaning, such as answer, use, 
need, display lexical restrictions consistent with that meaning (answer questions, use or need var-
ious kinds of resources). However, predicates that have multiple meanings demonstrate lexical 
restrictions speciﬁ c to the usage in which they have quantiﬁ cational semantics or implicatures: 
provide answers / information / services, but not provide new insights; address issues / questions / 
problems / needs, but not address the audience, address the envelope; meet criteria / requirements / 
demands / needs, but not meet friends. Some predicates have a single frequent instantiation in this 
construction: One size does not ﬁ ll all; Do not put all your eggs in one basket. These phrases re-
ﬂ ect the ultimate degree of lexicalization associated with quantiﬁ er-negated readings.

Thus, numerals and predicates with quantiﬁ cational meaning or implicatures can generally 
be considered markers of quantiﬁ er negation, while some of the non-quantiﬁ cational predicates 
are lexicalized as markers of quantiﬁ er negation only in speciﬁ c contexts.
4.3.5. The status of Q-negation markers
As Tables 1 and 2 demonstrate, Q-negation is by far the most frequent interpretation 
of not + Verb + all construction. It occurs even in situations when there are no markers facil-
itating its contextual recognition. In fact, it is the default interpretation of the not + Verb + all 
construction. Thus, unless the context contains markers of verb negation, the construction co-
erces interpretation of partial negation even onto such predicates that have no quantiﬁ cational 
components or implicatures. Consider the following EnTenTen examples with the verbs to hate, 
to reduce, to collapse, which do not have any quantiﬁ cational semantic components or impli-
catures outside of the construction not + Verb + all, but which develop them once placed in it:
(34) I don’t hate [all] kinds of self-portraits. [EnTenTen15]
(35) Cultural sociology does not reduce [all] human matters to a problem of cultural encoding 
and decoding. [EnTenTen15]
(36) Nietzsche does not collapse [all] of asceticism into its especially malignant form. 
[EnTenTen15]
20 
Voprosy Jazykoznanija 
2020. № 2
Thus, although the major part of Q-negated readings occurs in the context of predicates be-
longing to speciﬁ c semantic classes, quantiﬁ er negation does not in fact require any special mark-
ers for its identiﬁ cation in a given sentence. As mentioned above, numerals and predicates with 
quantiﬁ cational meaning or implicatures can be considered collexemes of the not + Verb + all 
construction, or its most frequent lexical ﬁ llers. According to [Tomasello 2003], lexical items 
that are more entrenched (frequent) in a given construction, or are, in [Gries, Stefanowitsch 
2004] parlance, its collexemes, are easier to acquire and use in that construction than the ones 
that are less entrenched. We can therefore expect speakers to make scope decisions in sentences 
with quantiﬁ cational predicates faster than in sentences with other kinds of predicates. However, 
that remains a hypothesis for further research.
4.4. Verb-negated readings
Lexical markers of V-negation are triggered by the following two factors: in V-negated read-
ings, (i) the verb is in the focus; (ii) the quantiﬁ er is interpreted in its emphatic meaning.
As concerns (i), we observe that the interpretation of total negation is normally available when 
the quantiﬁ cational group does not ﬁ ll a verbal argument, but has the status of an adjunct. This hap-
pens because in order to be negated, the verb has to be focused, while the quantiﬁ er should not be 
in the focus. If the quantiﬁ er phrase is an adjunct, especially a temporal modiﬁ er denoting a time 
period, it easily assumes the role of the topic: We didn’t move all night vs. All night, we didn’t move. 
Thus, temporal modiﬁ ers with all create contexts that are naturally interpreted with V-negation.
If the quantiﬁ er phrase ﬁ lls a verbal argument, V-negation is still available, yet it requires em-
phatic interpretation of the quantiﬁ er. Contexts that consolidate this interpretation are demon-
strative pronouns in their meaning of negative emphasis, frequently complemented by nega-
tively connoted lexical items.
(37) I didn’t [have time to read] all these pamphlets. [EnTenTen15]
(38) I don’t [want to get involved] in all this disgusting mess. [EnTenTen15]
4.4.1. Temporal modiﬁ ers in the quantiﬁ er phrase as markers of V-negation
Temporal modiﬁ ers with all facilitate V-negated readings. On the whole, they form the only 
type of a context where V-negated readings are pragmatically more neutral than Q-negated read-
ings, consider the following neutral statement:
(39) The baby didn’t [wake up] all night.
‘The baby did not wake once during the whole night.’
Q-negated readings of sentences with temporal modiﬁ ers are possible, but rare and pragmat-
ically non-neutral:
(40) I didn’t spend [all] day in front of the TV.
Sentences like (40) imply an opponent who claims the opposite (in this case, that the subject 
had spent an ������ day in front of the TV) and the quantiﬁ er phrase forms a contrastive focus.
It must be noted that V-negated and Q-negated readings of sentences with temporal modiﬁ -
ers are associated with diﬀ erent aspectual interpretations of the predicate. With V-negated read-
ings, the predicates are interpreted as achievements:
(41) He hadn’t [thought] of her all evening.
‘He hadn’t thought of her once during the entire evening.’
 
 Valentina Yu. Apresjan 
21
With Q-negated readings, the predicates are interpreted as states or activities:
(42) I hadn’t thought of him [all] evening, but only for the ﬁ rst hour or so.
‘I had thought of him for only part of the evening.’
Thus, V-negated and Q-negated readings of sentences with a temporal modiﬁ er in the quan-
tiﬁ er phrase are used in diﬀ erent types of speech acts. V-negated readings are usually state-
ments of noteworthy occurrences or, rather, non-occurrences. They state that a situation that 
would naturally be expected to occur at least once or more during a certain time period T, 
had not occurred at all during that time period. Q-negated readings are objections disprov-
ing someone’s statement that a certain situation was taking time during the entire time pe-
riod T, and claiming that the aforementioned situation was taking time only during a certain 
part of that period T.
As it turns out, the former situation is more frequent, as well as less context-dependent 
and more rooted in conventionalized human practices or universal background knowledge. 
Each of these situations has its typical instantiations. Diﬀ erent situation types are lexical-
ized in the combination of a predicate with the name of a time period. While certain combina-
tions can be interpreted either with V-negation or Q-negation, the most frequent combinations 
not + Verb + all + Time Period are ﬁ xed collocations reﬂ ecting lexicalizations of pragmatically 
plausible interpretations.
We have extracted and examined an additional sample of potentially ambiguous sentences 
to study the distribution of V-negated and Q-negated readings in this particular subgroup of sen-
tences with predicate negation and universal quantiﬁ er. We have considered collocations with 
two time periods — day and night. On the whole, we examined 100 sentences from EnTenTen15 
of not + Verb + all + night and 100 sentences of not + Verb + all + day structure from the same 
source. We considered their lexical set-up (namely, verbal collocates); typical real-life situations 
they refer to; scope readings of negation; the type of knowledge needed to infer the intended 
scope readings. The results are presented in Table 6.

Interpretations of sentences where all is part of a temporal modiﬁ er are inﬂ uenced by a vari-
ety of factors, both linguistic and extralinguistic. A purely linguistic factor that aﬀ ects readings 
of sentences with negation and temporal modiﬁ er with all, is the aspectual class of the predi-
cate. If the predicate can only be understood as an achievement (such as to stop, to interrupt, 
etc.), the sentence is uniformly interpreted with V-negation, even in the absence of any pre-
vious knowledge of the situation and irrespectively of the time period: He didn’t stop talking 
all day / all night ‘He didn’t stop talking at all during the entire day / night’. Likewise, if the 
predicate can only be interpreted as a state or activity (such as to last), it is invariably inter-
preted with Q-negation: The meeting didn’t last all day / all night ‘The meeting lasted for part 
of the day / night’.
However, since the majority of predicates in English can be interpreted both as activities 
(states) and accomplishments, most of the time the choice of a pragmatically plausible interpre-
tation requires extralinguistic knowledge. This extralinguistic knowledge is of two kinds: gen-
eral and contextual.
Table 6 (continued)
 
 Valentina Yu. Apresjan 
23
By general extralinguistic knowledge we mean knowledge that reﬂ ects universal human prac-
tices. A prime example is the tendency to sleep during the night. Because the majority of peo-
ple tend to sleep at least for part of the night, a total lack of sleep constitutes a gross violation 
of usual practices, and as such is worthy of a special mention. Thus, V-negated interpretation 
of strings X didn’t sleep all night ‘X didn’t sleep at all during the night’ represents an informa-
tive and, therefore, pragmatically plausible reading.
On the contrary, a Q-negated reading of such sentences would be a stretch from the pragmatic 
point of view. The interpretation of partial negation ‘X didn’t sleep the whole night, but only part’ 
requires someone’s claim in the preceding context that X slept all night, which the speaker as-
pires to disprove. While a V-negated reading of the string X didn’t sleep all night is a regularly 
made and easily understood statement about nocturnal insomnia, a Q-negated reading requires 
constructing a fairly complicated (and highly improbable) context. For example, somebody ac-
cuses a night security guard of unprofessional behavior, namely, sleeping the whole night; the 
speaker defends the guard by claiming that the guard slept for only part of the night. Unsurpris-
ingly, all 267 occurrences of not sleep all night in EnTenTen are interpreted with V-negation. 
Thus, this expression can be considered a lexicalized instance of V-negation, triggered by gen-
eral extralinguistic knowledge.
The two most frequent lexicalized instances of V-negation reﬂ ecting universal extralinguistic 
knowledge are not [sleep] all night ‘not sleep at all during the night’ and not [eat] all day ‘not 
eat at all during the day’ which reﬂ ect the most frequent violations of general human practices 
to sleep at least part of the night and eat at least once every day.
The most frequent lexicalized instance of Q-negation is not [have] all day ‘to have only part 
of the day available’, which reﬂ ects a universal approach to the daytime as a resource for dif-
ferent activities. In addition, the interpretation of partial negation is also more plausible from 
the linguistic point of view: in English, to report a total lack of resource, speakers would nor-
mally use negative construction: I have no bread, I don’t have any bread, but not *I don’t have 
all bread (also, see Discussion).
By contextual extralinguistic knowledge we mean the knowledge of particular circumstances 
that allows the reader to reach a pragmatically plausible decision. E.g., phrases like Restaurants 
don’t serve all night; Buses don’t run all night; The dog didn’t bark all day; The baby didn’t cry 
all day cannot be interpreted without a larger context because there are no universal tendencies 
or rules concerning these situations. Restaurants can be closed for part of the night or for the 
whole night; likewise, buses can run for part of the night or not at all, depending on the practices 
of a speciﬁ c place. Babies can cry for part of the day or can totally abstain from crying, as well 
as dogs can make some noise or not at all, depending on speciﬁ c circumstances. While state-
ments about the total lack of activity during a speciﬁ c time period are more informative from 
the point of view of Gricean maxims of communication, speciﬁ c practices might prevent inter-
pretations based on cooperation principles. Sometimes, the choice of one interpretation is im-
possible; consider the following ambiguous sentences from our EnTenTen15 sample:
(43) Some restaurants keep late hours, others may not serve all night. [EnTenTen15]
either ‘not serve at all during the night’ or ‘serve for only part of the night’
(44) Many employees rely on subway which doesn’t run all night. [EnTenTen15]
either ‘does not run at all during the night’ or ‘runs for only part of the night’
On the whole, we can observe that night triggers clearer expectations as to the choice of con-
ventionalized occupations: it is the time for sleep. As a result, almost half of the negative sen-
tences with all night contain sleep and are lexicalized with V-negation.
Day, naturally, presents a greater choice of activities and, hence, possible interpretations of ne-
gation scope. The most frequent violation of diurnal conventions is not eating. Hence, over one 
ﬁ fth of our not + Verb + all day sample (22 hits) is comprised by a lexicalized V-negated collo-
cation not eat all day. Q-negation also has a frequent lexicalized expression, such as not have 
24 
Voprosy Jazykoznanija 
2020. № 2
all day (23 hits in our day sample). However, its collocation strength and, hence, recognizabil-
ity, is considerably lower (see Tables 7 and 8). In both night and day samples, lexicalized V-ne-
gated readings, reﬂ ecting universal extralinguistic knowledge, form the top of the frequency. 
Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that temporal modiﬁ ers with all, especially all night, are 
markers of V-negation.

4.4.2. Pragmaticalized demonstratives
as markers of verb-negated readings
As mentioned above, demonstratives this and that in their pragmaticalized usage of express-
ing negative attitude serve as markers of those V-negated readings that involve an emphatic in-
terpretation of the quantiﬁ er. Introducing them into the quantiﬁ er phrase increases the likelihood 
of a V-negated interpretation. Consider the following sentences:
(45) I did not eat all the vegetables.
(46) I did not eat all these vegetables.
(47) I do not trust all doctors.
(48) I do not trust all those doctors.
 
 Valentina Yu. Apresjan 
25
Sentences (45) and (47), without the demonstratives, are likely to be interpreted with Q-nega-
tion: ‘I ate part of the vegetables’, ‘I trust part of the doctors’. However, sentences (46) and (48), 
with demonstratives, are likely to receive V-negated interpretations: ‘I did not eat any of these 
(disgusting) vegetables’, ‘I do not trust any of those (incompetent) doctors’.
Consider also the following sentences from COCA, where (49) without a demonstrative is 
interpreted quantitatively with partial negation, and (50) with a demonstrative is interpreted em-
phatically with total negation:
(49) Some transsexuals cannot aﬀ ord [all] the surgeries necessary to full sex assignment. [En-
TenTen15]
‘Some transsexuals can aﬀ ord part of the necessary surgeries.’
(50) The residents of Leavenworth cannot [aﬀ ord] all these extra expenses that tourism has 
brought. [EnTenTen15]
‘The residents cannot aﬀ ord any of the considerable tourism-associated extra expenses.’
To verify the validity of demonstratives this and that as markers of V-negated readings, we 
analyzed all strings not + Verb + all + this, not + Verb + all + these, not + Verb + all + those 
found in COCA. The string not + Verb + all + that was excluded from the analysis because all 
examples with it turned out to contain the syntactic phraseme all that X (He doesn’t seem all 
that happy), which renders them useless for our purposes. Minus “noise”, we analyzed the total 
of 83 examples: 27 sentences with not Verb all this, 34 sentences with not Verb all these, and 
22 sentences with not Verb all those. The results are summarized in Table 9.

We can see that verb negation is indeed by far the predominant interpretation of the construc-
tion with negation, universal quantiﬁ er and demonstratives, so demonstratives can be consid-
ered a reliable marker of V-negation.
A closer analysis of the examples shows that in the majority of the sentences, the demonstra-
tives are indeed not used in their primary function, but as markers of negative emphasis. In many 
cases, their interpretation as markers of negative attitude is triggered by the predicate. Namely, 
predicates that carry positive messages, in combination with negation express negative attitude, 
and, thus, entail emphatic interpretation of the demonstratives. Consider the following examples 
from COCA, where the use of the emphatic quantiﬁ er with the emphatic demonstrative creates 
additional implicit negative assessment:
(51) She did not [like] all this attention for Christina when she, Dolly, was there. [COCA]
‘She did not like any of this (redundant) attention for Christina.’
(52) This is unacceptable. I cannot [allow] all these intrusions. [COCA]
‘I cannot allow any of these (bothersome) intrusions.’
(53) I’m not [enjoying] all this talk about George W. Bush’s past life. [COCA]
‘I don’t enjoy any of this (evil) talk about George Bush’s past life.’

(54) Our satisfaction is in God. We do not [need] all these extra things. [COCA]
‘We do not need any of these extra (mundane, vain) things.’
(55) But when it comes to our own, we [should] not make all those excuses. [COCA]
‘We should not make any of those (self-justifying) excuses.’
Interpreting these sentences with Q-negation is a pragmatically implausible decision: it is 
indeed bizarre to suppose that one’s negative attitude to a situation or an object only applies 
to some aspects / instances of that situation or some aspects / amounts of that object. This might 
be a manifestation of a certain cognitive tendency: people tend to generalize negative impres-
sions more often than positive ones. This intuition is somewhat conﬁ rmed by the frequencies 
of like vs. don’t like statements in EnTenTen15. We have formulated four queries: I like all + 
Noun, I like some + Noun, I don’t like any + Noun, I don’t like some + Noun. The results are 
in Table 10:
Table 10

and negative attitude in EnTen Ten15

Though this data is insuﬃ  cient for making any strong claims, it appears that in making neg-
ative statements, people generalize comparatively more often than in making positive state-
ments, and that selective positive statements occur comparatively more frequently than selec-
tive negative statements. This cognitive tendency has a clear experiential basis: a small defect 
can entirely spoil something valuable, while the opposite is not true; cf. folk sayings ﬂ y in the 
ointment, Russian ložka dëgtja v bočke mëda ‘a spoon of tar in the barrel of honey’, German ein 
Haar in der Suppe ‘a hair in the soup’.
When the predicate does not support negative emphatic interpretation of the quantiﬁ er and 
the demonstrative, Q-negation becomes possible. Consider the following ambiguous sentence 
from COCA:
(55) U.S. policy cannot ﬁ x all these gaps, but it can help.
With emphatic interpretation of the quantiﬁ er, it means ‘US policy cannot ﬁ x any of the un-
pleasant and/or numerous gaps in question, but it can still help’. With quantiﬁ cational interpre-
tation of all, it means ‘US policy can ﬁ x only some of the gaps in question but it can help’. Thus, 
demonstratives produce a number of ambiguous readings (three in the EnTenTen15 sample, four 
in the COCA sample), where both emphatic and non-emphatic interpretations of the quantiﬁ er 
and the demonstrative are pragmatically plausible.
However, on the whole, demonstratives this and that are fairly reliable markers of V-negation, 
especially when their negative emphatic interpretation is supported by other negative elements 
of the context. Those are usually of two types: mental predicates with the meaning of good at-
titude (love, like, approve, enjoy, want, believe), which in combination with negation express 
negative attitude, or else negatively connoted nouns or adjectives in the quantiﬁ er phrase (all 
these disgusting details, all these idiots).
4.4.2. Negative assessment as a marker of V-negation
In principle, markers of Q-negation and V-negation can compete in a sentence. E.g., verbs 
like know in the absence of other clues entail Q-negation:
 
 Valentina Yu. Apresjan 
27
(56) I didn’t know [all] the details. = ‘I knew some of the details, but not all.’
 Introducing these or those into the utterance creates the possibility of emphatic interpretation 
and, thus, of V-negation: I didn’t know all these details can mean either ‘I knew some of the de-
tails, but not all’ (Q-negation) or ‘I didn’t know any of the details’ (V-negation). Adding another 
marker of V-negation, namely, a lexical item expressing negative assessment, consolidates the 
emphatic interpretation, and, hence, a V-negated reading:
(57) I don’t want to know all these details. = ‘I don’t want to know any of the details.’
(58) Don’t tell me all these disgusting details. = ‘Don’t tell me any of these disgusting details.’
Markers of the second type, namely, negatively connoted lexical items (idiots, disgusting) 
are stronger markers of V-negation than those that express negative attitude only in combi-
nation with negation (want, like). On their own, predicates like want and like are insuﬃ  cient 
to render a phrase V-negated. Sentences I don’t want to know [all the details]; I don’t trust 
[all] healers are likely to be interpreted with Q-negation ‘I want to know only some of the 
details’, ‘I trust only some healers’. Adding a demonstrative creates negative emphasis and 
results in V-negation:
(59) I don’t [want to know] all these details. = ‘I don’t want to know any of these (sordid) de-
tails.’
(60) I don’t [like] all these healers. = ‘I don’t like all these (untrustworthy) healers.’
Strong markers of V-negation, or items that incorporate negative assessment in their lexical 
meaning, are infelicitous in the absence of emphatic demonstratives: ?? Don’t tell me all the dis-
gusting details; ?? I won’t talk to all the idiots; ?? I don’t believe all the bullshit. This is a mani-
festation of general referential properties of qualitative nouns, or nouns that carry strong eval-
uation, such as shit, rubbish, junk, scoundrel, etc. They are normally used non-referentially, 
as predicates: This is rubbish, but not *We discussed the rubbish for an hour. In order to be 
used with speciﬁ c reference, they require “pronoun determiners that take on the indexing role” 
[Arutyunova 1976: 348–349; Shmelyov 1996: 206–207].
4.5. Q-negation as the default reading 
of not + Verb + all sentences: Discussion
One of the main questions posed by our results is the motivation behind the statistical prom-
inence of Q-negated readings. Why is Q-negation the default scope reading of sentences with 
predicate negation and universal quantiﬁ er? We have demonstrated that in the majority of con-
texts it is semantically and pragmatically neutral, unlike V-negation, which can explain its sig-
niﬁ cantly higher frequency. The question remains, why is V-negation of not + Verb + all sen-
tences semantically and pragmatically marked?
We suggest that Q-negated reading is the default option of interpreting not + Verb + all sen-
tences for pragmatic reasons. Logically, the expressions ¬∃x (x = y) and ∀x (x ≠ y) are equiv-
alent, as are the expressions ¬∀x (x = y) and ∃x (x ≠ y). However, pragmatically these expres-
sions may be very diﬀ erent. We will demonstrate that V-negated interpretation of sentences with 
universal quantiﬁ er (∀x (x ≠ y)) is not a pragmatically neutral way of expressing the meaning 
of total negation in English. V-negated strings of not + Verb + all structure express a range of ad-
ditional pragmatic shades, are pragmatically marked, and are, therefore, only used in a fraction 
of contexts with total negation. To express total negation in the majority of contexts, English 
normally uses negative pronouns, such as nobody, nothing, etc.; total negation can also be ex-
pressed by the NPI pronouns anybody, anything, etc., combined with a negated verb.
28

2020. № 2
However, what is the diﬀ erence between total negation expressed by negative pronouns and 
total negation which we ﬁ nd in V-negated readings of not + Verb + all construction? Consider 
the following pairs of sentences with negative pronouns and not + Verb + all construction, re-
spectively:
(61) I have no time.
(62) *I don’t have all time.
The sentence with a negative pronoun is felicitous, whereas the sentence with all and pred-
icate negation is not. On the contrary, in the next pair of sentences, the sentence with all and 
predicate negation is felicitous and the sentence with the negative pronoun is not:
(63) She didn’t sleep all night.
(64) *She slept no night.
To explain this diﬀ erence, we have to formulate the diﬀ erence between the meaning expressed 
by negative pronouns and the meaning expressed by a combination of a negated verb and uni-
versal quantiﬁ er when both are possible:
(65) I don’t read any newspapers.
(66) I don’t read all these newspapers.
We suggest that utterances with negative pronouns deny the existence of ��� objects that sat-
isfy the conditions speciﬁ ed by the predicate and thus do not deﬁ ne sets or domains of discourse. 
They can be used without any speciﬁ cation of the potential members that could satisfy the prop-
ositional function. On the other hand, the universal quantiﬁ er all necessarily points to a certain 
set, or domain, whose members satisfy the propositional function without exception. Even when 
the propositional function is negative, as is the case with not [V ] all X construction, the domain 
is predeﬁ ned: we are talking about a certain set in question whose elements do not, without ex-
ception, satisfy the propositional function. Therefore, if we have not speciﬁ ed the domain in any 
way in the previous discourse, the phrase is infelicitous or else impossible to interpret with V-ne-
gation. Thus, phrases like (61), where it is impossible to introduce the idea of a deﬁ nite set, are 
not felicitous with not + Verb + all structure. Likewise, sentences like (63), where the domain 
of discourse is necessarily deﬁ ned by context (we are talking about a speciﬁ c night), are im-
possible with negative pronouns. Sentences where both constructions are possible, have diﬀ er-
ent meanings: in (65), the speaker denies reading any newspapers that potentially exist in the 
world, while in (66), the speaker denies reading any of the newspapers that have been mentioned 
previously (the use of a demonstrative pronoun is obligatory for a V-negated reading in (66)).
Thus, the meaning of total negation expressed by the strings not + Verb + all is pragmatically 
non-neutral relative to other means of expressing total negation, and only occurs in very spe-
ciﬁ c pragmatic circumstances. Therefore, such strings can only be interpreted with V-negation 
in the presence of special markers, and Q-negated interpretations become the default reading.
5. Conclusion
We have conducted a corpus study of scope readings of negation in sentences with predicate 
negation and universal quantiﬁ er all, such as Bars don’t serve all night; I don’t know all the de-
tails. On the whole, we have analyzed about 1500 sentences with this structure, extracted from 
EnTenTen15 and COCA corpora. We have demonstrated that the lexical set-up of these sen-
tences can serve as a predictor of their pragmatically plausible interpretations and, hence, their 
probable information structures and scope readings.

The two main scope readings of not + Verb + all sentences are Q-negation (partial negation) 
and V-negation (total negation): I haven’t talked to [all] my students (Q-negation, ‘I have talked 
to only part of my students’); I don’t [want] to talk to all these stuﬀ y bureaucrats (V-negation, 
‘I don’t want to talk to any of these stuﬀ y bureaucrats’). While Q-negation is a pragmatically 
neutral reading in most contexts, V-negation is pragmatically charged. Q-negation entails literal 
interpretation of the quantiﬁ er all in its direct quantiﬁ cational meaning; V-negation mostly en-
tails emphatic interpretation of all in its meaning of negative emphasis.
Lexical markers of Q-negation and V-negation are determined by their semantic and prag-
matic peculiarities, namely (i) partially or totally negated interpretation of the sentence and (ii) 
quantiﬁ cational or emphatic interpretation of the quantiﬁ er. The interpretation of partial or total 
negation is triggered by the information structure of the sentence: for partial negation, quanti-
ﬁ er is in the focus, for total negation, verb is in the focus.
Therefore, Q-negation mostly occurs with predicates that take a quantiﬁ cational argument 
as a direct object (to include, to list, to ﬁ nish), or else easily take a quantiﬁ able argument (to know, 
to meet requirements, to answer criteria) because such predicates are conducive both to plac-
ing the quantiﬁ er in the focus and interpreting it in its literal quantiﬁ cational meaning. V-nega-
tion occurs with temporal modiﬁ ers containing all (such as all night) because they are condu-
cive to placing the verb in the focus. It also occurs with emphatic demonstratives and negatively 
connoted lexical items because they consolidate the emphatic interpretation of the quantiﬁ er all.
Q-negation occurs considerably more frequently than V-negation due to its pragmatic neutral-
ity. Generally, in the absence of markers of V-negation, not + Verb + all strings are interpreted 
with Q-negation. The construction coerces Q-negated readings even onto predicates that do not 
have quantiﬁ cational meaning or implicatures.
