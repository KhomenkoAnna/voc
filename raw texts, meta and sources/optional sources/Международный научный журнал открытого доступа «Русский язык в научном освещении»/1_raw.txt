RUSSIAN U Y-A EST´/– X CONSTRUCTIONS 
The paper considers the problem of choice between the construction U Y-a est´ Х lit. 
‘At Y is X’ (with the form est´ of the verb BYT´ ‘be’) and the construction U Y-a Х lit. 
‘At Y X’ (with the zero form of the verb BYT´). This choice is determined by the meaning to 
be expressed, that is, practically it can be reduced to the choice of the corresponding one of 
several verbs BYT´ ‘be’. As the first approximation, the starting meaning ‘Y is a semantic ac-
tant of X’ (U IvanaY temperaturaХ / èkzamenХ / dvoe detejХ ‘At Ivan [high] tempera-
ture / [an] exam / two kids’) is expressed by the verb BYT´II.3 and by the construction U Y-a 
Х; the meaning ‘Y has Х’ (U IvanaY est´ dačaХ / special´nyj pomoščnikХ / vremjaХ ‘At Ivan is 
[a] summer.house / [a] special assistant / time’) is expressed by the verb BYT´III.2 and by the 
construction U Y-a est´ Х. The paper also presents the vocable BYT´, with 13 lexemes; five of 
these, which participate in the constructions under analysis, are accompanied with full lexico-
graphic descriptions. A series of particular cases is analyzed in which the choice of the appro-
priate construction is complicated by additional conditions. Formal semantic rules for the 
production of both constructions are supplied. 
 
Keywords: Russian language, semantics, syntax, semantics-syntax interface, the verb

1. The problem stated 
The scientific problem discussed in this paper arose, as is often the case, 
from a very practical, down-to-earth difficulty:

How to explain to my nice grandchildren, speaking (sometimes halting) Russian, 
when you have to say in Russian U Y-a est´ X ‘At Y is X’ and when U Y-a X 
‘At Y X’, i. e., without an overt verb form? 
 
As common wisdom has it, in different contexts, either only the est´-
construction is correct — (1a), or only the no-overt-verb construction is — (1b), 
or both constructions are correct with different meanings — (1c), or, finally, 
both are correct with (roughly) the same meaning — (1d): 
 
(1) a. U Ivana est´ èta kniga ‘At Ivan is this book’ = ‘Ivan has this book’. ~ 
 
 *U Ivana èta kniga ‘At Ivan this book’. 
 
NB: 1. Here and below, all example sentences are supposed to fit into a communica-
tively neutral context — that is, to be uttered, among other things, with a 
neutral declarative prosody (interrogative and exclamative sentences are ex-
cluded from consideration). Thus: 
  
  
➚ 
➘ 
 
(i) *U Ivana èta kniga ‘Ivan has this book’. 
 
 
 
But the expression U Ivana èta kniga is correct, if ‘u Ivana’ is a Focalized 
Rheme, as in an answer to the question Where could this book be?;1 for in-
stance: 
  
 
 
(ii) U IvánaSem-RHEME, Focalized èta kniga ‘At Ivan this book’. ≈ ‘It is Ivan who 
has this book’. 
 
 
 
Sentence (ii) expresses a meaning different from that of sentence (1a): 
(1a) speaks of Ivan and tells us that he has this book, while (ii) indicates that 
the location of the book is ‘at Ivan’. 
 
  
➘ 
➚ 
➘ 
 
(iii) U Ivana ètaRh-Focus kniga ‘At Ivan this book’. ≈ ‘Ivan has exactly this book’. 
 
 
 
Sentence (iii) tells us that the book Ivan has is exactly this book — a meaning 
that again is different from that of sentence (1a). 
 
2. Since the present paper concentrates on the grammatical correctness of the 
two constructions, our examples are lexically the simplest possible; therefore, 
some of them do not sound quite natural out of context. 
                                                        
1 The Semantic Rheme of a sentence S is the part of the meaning ‘S’ (of this sen-
tence) that the Speaker presents as stated by means of S; the Rhematic Focus is the 
part of Sem-R that supplies the value of the unknown element in the underlying question 
to which S can be an appropriate answer; Focalized is the part of the meaning ‘S’ that 
the Speaker presents as logically prominent. For instance: 
(i) 
JohnSem-T was seen there last FridaySem-R. 
  
 Rh-F 
(ii) 
JohnSem-T was seen there  lást   FridaySem-R. 
(iii) As for John, heSem-T, Focalized was seen there last FridaySem-R. 
(iv) It was thereSem-R, Focalized that John was seen last FridaySem-T.

3. The asterisks in examples (1) are not mine: they correspond to the judgments 
of grammaticality found in most publications on the U Y-a est´/– X construc-
tions. It will be shown in this paper that the expressions under consideration 
are ungrammatical only with respect to a given meaning. 
 
 
b. U Ivana golubye glaza ‘At Ivan blue eyes’ = ‘Ivan has blue eyes’. ~ 
 
 *U Ivana est´ golubye glaza. 
 
 
c. (i) U Ivana est´ takoj nož ‘At Ivan is such knife’ = ‘Ivan has such a  
 
   
knife’. ~ 
 
   
*U Ivana takoj nož. 
 
  (ii) Ostorožno, u Ivana nož ‘Careful, at Ivan knife’ = ‘Careful, Ivan has a  
 
   
knife’ [a warning]. ~ 
 
   
*Ostorožno, u Ivana est´ nož. 
 
 
d. (i) U Ivana k tebe est´ vopros ‘At Ivan to you is question’ = ‘Ivan has a  
 
   
question for you’. ≡ 
 (ii) U Ivana k tebe vopros ‘At Ivan to you question’ = ‘Ivan has a ques-
tion for you’. 
 
The literature concerning the two constructions is vast; I will mention only 
four major titles: the pioneering studies [Селивёрстова 1973; 1990: 66 — 88; 
Янко 2001: 309 — 326], and [Апресян В. 2017]. The works by Yanko and 
V. Apresjan, which propose detailed and well illustrated analyses of the U Y-a 
est´/– X constructions, together with a good presentation of the relevant knowl-
edge and a complete bibliography, have been especially useful for me. In par-
ticular, Yanko [Янко 2001] establishes the main semantic contrast between the 
two constructions: roughly, “U Y-a X” means ‘Y is a participant of situation X’, 
while “U Y-a est´ X” means ‘Y has at his disposal a useful X’; V. Apresjan 
[Апресян В. 2017] supplies an exhaustive inventory of semantic classes of pos-
sible Xs. I used many of Yanko’s and V. Apresjan’s examples and some of their 
proposals and conclusions, while trying to make another step forward. 
 
In a nutshell, the problem that this paper is intended to solve can be formu-
lated as follows: 
 
To state the formal rules necessary and sufficient to produce all and only cor-
rect occurrences of both U Y-a est´/– X constructions. 
 
Formally, both constructions I am interested in have the following surface-
syntactic structure: 
 
oblique-objectival
 
 
U–prepositional→Y BYT´–subjectival→X 
 
— The preposition U ‘at’, which is essential for these constructions, is se-
mantically empty (= does not correspond to a semanteme): it is governed by the 
corresponding verb BYT´ and does not appear in the deep-syntactic structure. 
— Both constructions have to be examined in the present tense of the indica-
tive mood, since in the past and future tenses, as well as in the subjunctive-
Igor M e l’ č u k  
10 
conditional, all BYT´ verbs (see Subsection 2.2) have the same inflectional 
forms: byl, byla, bylo, budu, budeš´, … Only in the present indicative is it possi-
ble to tease them apart: some BYT´ verbs in some particular contexts feature the 
zero lex ØBYT´, some use the lex est´, and still some other allow both lexes de-
pending on the context. This difference is described by means of distinguishing 
several BYT´ verbs: the U Y-a est´ X construction contains BYT´II.3, BYT´II.4 or 
BYT´III.1, and the U Y-a X construction BYT´II.3, BYT´II.5 or BYT´III.2; the lexi-
cographic definitions of these verbs will be given below, Subsection 2.2. 
— X and Y can have various dependents, actants as well as modifiers, and 
these dependents can be relevant for the grammaticality and pragmatic accept-
ability of a given construction. Thus, *U Ivana sosed ‘At Ivan neighbor’ is in-
correct for the meaning ‘Ivan has a neighbor’ (the correct expression: U Ivana 
est´ sosed ‘At Ivan is neighbor’), while U Ivana novyj sosed ‘At Ivan new 
neighbor’ = ‘Ivan has a new neighbor’ is impeccable. 
— The U Y-a X construction should not be confused with a case of syntacti-
cally induced ellipsis of the est´ form. Thus, in sentence (2), the clauses 2 and 3 
feature the U Y-a est´ X construction that has undergone ellipsis: 
 
(2)  [U menja est´ serdce]1, a [u serdca — pesnja]2, a [u pesni — tajna]3 
 
‘At me is heart, and at heart song, and at song secret’ [a popular Soviet 
tango of 1930s]. 
 
Before we plunge into the heart of the matter, two warnings: 
— The English glosses to Russian examples (throughout the paper) are 
mostly literal. Several English words that correspond to one Russian word are 
united by periods: budet ‘will.be’. 
— My approach is strictly synthetic — from meaning to text. Therefore, if a 
text T is supplied with the gloss ‘g’, this means that ‘g’ can be expressed by T, 
not that ‘g’ is the only meaning of T. 
2. Preparing the solution 
2.1. Terms to avoid 
In a study like the present one, the use of precise notions and, consequently, 
precise terminology is vital. Therefore, first of all, the following three terms fre-
quently used in the discussions of the U Y-a est´/– X constructions must be 
banned, because of their misleading connotations: 
•  The term *copula as applied to the verbs BYT´ ‘be’ found in the U Y-a 
est´/– X constructions. The fact is that these BYT´ are by no means copulas! 
(Several BYT´ verbs are, of course, copulas, but these do not appear in our 
constructions; for an inventory of BYT´ lexemes, see Subsection 3.2) 
•  The term *zero verb as applied to the absence of an overt verb form in the 
U Y-a X construction. This construction contains not a *zero verb, but the 
Russian U Y-a est´/– X constructions 
11 
zero form of one of the verbs BYT´ — namely, ØBYT´II.3, ØBYT´II.5 or 
ØBYT´III.2, which are the present tense wordforms of the verbs BYT´II.3, 
BYT´II.5 and BYT´III.2 (they are by no means zero verbs; on zero lexemes, 
see [Mel’čuk 2006: 447 — 495]). 
• The term *possessive construction as applied to both our constructions. The 
notion of “possession” is semantically too vague to be used in this case. 
Even the sentence U Ivana est´ èta kniga ‘At Ivan is this book’, which is 
the closest example of “possession,” can be continued …, no ona emu ne 
prinadležit ‘…, but it does not belong to him’. The semantic relation be-
tween Y and X manifested in the constructions under analysis is not “pos-
session,” but a very general and vague “involvement.” This meaning is 
considered indecomposable — a semantic primitive; in our description it is 
expressed by the semanteme ‘have’ (in Russian, it is ‘imet´sja’ ≈ ‘be.had’). 
2.2. The verb BYT´ in Russian 
A U Y-a est´/– X construction is controlled, as will be shown, by one of the 
five lexemes of the verbal vocable BYT´ ‘be’: respectively, BYT´II.3, BYT´II.4, 
BYT´II.5, BYT´III.1, and BYT´III.2. Therefore, it is necessary to present here a 
short description of the vocable BYT´. This description has been elaborated on 
the basis of Ju. Apresjan’s paper [Апресян 2014] (where a detailed characteriza-
tion of syntactic, lexical-combinatorial, prosodic and morphological properties 
of the different BYT´ is offered) — with some changes2. 
                                                        
2 Modifications made in this paper with respect to Ju. Apresjan’s [Апресян 2014] list: 
• From Apresjan’s 16 BYT´ lexemes the following 9 are left out: 
Byt´ 2.2 (On uže byl v dva časa ‘He already was [here] at two o’clock’.) is consid-
ered to be a particular case of byt´ 2.1 ‘be.located (= our BYT´IV ‘be.located’). 
Byt´ 4.2 and 4.4 (Bylo pjat´ časov ‘[It] was five o’clock’ and S nim beda ‘With him 
accident’.) are considered to be particular cases of byt´ 4.3 ‘take place, happen’ 
(= our BYT´II.2 ‘take place’). 
Byt´ 5.1 (the inevitability of an event: Byt´ groze ‘To.be to.thunderstorm’ = 
‘A thunderstorm will happen’.) is considered to be a particular manifestation of 
the syntactic construction VINF→NDAT, which is available with many different 
verbs (Vojne eščë gremet´ i pylat´ ‘The war will still be rumbling and flaming’ 
or Žit´ im i žit´ ‘They will still live and live’.). BYT´ in this construction is 
byt´ 4.3 ‘take place, happen’. 
Byt´ 5.2 (the inevitability of a bad event: Nam kryška lit. ‘To.us kaput’ = ‘We are 
done in’.) is considered to be a particular case of byt´ 1.1 (the copula; our 
BYT´I.1), used as a light verb with such nouns as KRYŠKA ‘≈ kaput’, KAPUT 
‘kaput’, KONEC ‘end’ or XANA ‘≈ kaput’. 
Byt´ 5.3 and 5.4 — the lexical items BUDET (‘enough’, as in Enough crying!) — 
are considered to be lexemes of a separate vocable BUDET (Budet s tebja 
‘You’ve had enough’; Budet tebe plakat´ ‘Enough to.you to.cry’). 
Byt´ 6.1 and 6.2 (BYT´ as an auxiliary) are also considered to be particular uses of 
byt´ 1.1 (the copula; our BYT´I.1). 
Igor M e l’ č u k  
12 
In the examples below, all BYT´ verbs are cited in the present tense of the in-
dicative mood, since the problematic phenomena in the two constructions mani-
fest themselves only in the present. For each lexeme of BYT´ its possible inflec-
tional forms of the present tense are indicated — both in the default (= general) 
case and in some special cases, that is, under special conditions, which are speci-
fied in the corresponding lexical entry. The present tense BYT´ forms are: 
 
1)  a zero form ØBYT´ 3 
2)  est´ for both a singular and a plural subject 
3)  est´/sut´ for a singular/plural subject, respectively 
4)  budet, actually the future tense form of BYT´; it is used in a few specific 
cases in the sense of the present, such as Dvaždy tri budet šest´ 
‘Two.times three is [lit. ‘will.be’] six’. | A vy kto budete? ‘And you who 
are [lit. ‘will.be’]?’ | V nëm 20 kilo budet ‘In it 20 kg is [lit. ‘will.be’]’ = 
‘It weighs about 20 kilos’. This use is stylistically marked (colloquial). 
 
These forms, except budet, are not conjugated by person: they are the same 
for any person. Not all of them are possible for all verbs of BYT´: BYT´I.1 has 
ØBYT´ and est´, BYT´I.2 and BYT´I.3 — ØBYT´ and est´/sut´, BYT´I.4 — ØBYT´ and 
budet, etc. 
The four wordforms above are suppletive lexes of the corresponding verbal 
lexemes; the selection of the appropriate one is performed by deep-
morphological rules, based on the information stored in the lexicographic entries 
for the verbs BYT´. 
Since an in-depth characterization of the BYT´ lexemes is far beyond the goal 
of this paper, several important details are ignored. Thus, the use of the pronoun 
ÈTO ‘it’ with some of the copulas, but not with the others — as, e. g., in 
Romb — èto četyrëxugol´nik ‘Diamond it [is] quadrangle’ vs. *Ivan — èto vrač 
‘Ivan it [is] doctor’ — is left out; see [Mel’čuk 2012]. 
 
BYT´ ‘be’ 
 
I. Copula 
1. BYT´I.1 ‘X←1–Y’ [“X is Y”] 
BYT´I.1 is semantically empty—that is, 
its signified contains no semantemes; it 
has no source in the starting semantic

• Six BYT´ lexemes are added: two copular lexemes (BYT´I.3 — BYT´I.4, based on 
[Mel’čuk 2012]), three “existential” lexemes BYT´II.3 — BYT´II.5 and the “avail-
ability” lexeme BYT´III.2 are introduced as a result of the present research.  
• Apresjan’s lexicographic numbering of the lexemes inside the BYT´ vocable has 
been changed in order to make the semantic bridges better visible.

analogous properties of overt forms) are found in [Летучий 2013].

Comments 
1. The vocable BYT´ features four lexeme groupings: I. copula, II. existence, 
III. availability, and IV. location; this is a fairly traditional set. The lexeme 
BYT´I.1 is semantically empty, and the lexemes BYT´II.1, BYT´III.1 and BYT´IV 
express semantic primitives (which agrees with Anna Wierzbicka’s views — 
see, for instance, [Goddard, Wierzbicka 2014: 12]: 
BYT´I.1: ‘X←1–Y’ | BYT´II.1: ‘X exists’ | BYT´III.1: ‘X is.had.by Y’ 4 |  
BYT´IV: ‘X is.located.in Y’ 
This fact allows me to include these lexemes in one vocable (together with 
all other BYT´ verbs): even if there are no explicit semantic bridges between 
them, formally — syntactically and morphologically — they are closely related. 
2. The lexeme BYT´I.1 — the pure copula — verbalizes non-verbal semanti-
cally predicative lexemes; DSynt-actant II [⇔ ‘Y’] of the verb BYT´I.1 must be a 
genuine semantic predicate. BYT´I.1 also describes the grammatical (as an auxil-
iary verb) and semi-grammatical (as a support verb) uses of BYT´: 
 — BYT´ as an auxiliary in the passive. For instance, Dom ØBYT´I.1/byl/budet 
postroen ‘The house is/was/will.be built’ and in the imperfective future tense My 
budemBYT´I.1 stroit´ dom ‘We will.be building the house’. 
 — BYT´ as a support (= light) verb with predicative adverbs of the type 
MOŽNO ≈ ‘is.possible’ or XOLODNO ≈ ‘is.cold’. For instance, Možno vojti? 
‘[Is it] possible to.go.in?’, with the surface-syntactic structure including an 
empty zero dummy subject Ø(neu,sg)
empty  ≈ ‘it’: 
Ø(neu,sg)
empty  ←subjectival–BYT´I.1–copular-attributive-objectival→MOŽNO 
                                                        
4 BYT´III.1 also expresses the semanteme ‘useful [to X]’. 
Igor M e l’ č u k  
16 
Or else, Ivanu xolodno ‘To.Ivan cold’ = ‘Ivan is cold’, with the surface-syntactic 
structure 
 
Ø(neu,sg)
empty  ←subjectival–BYT´I.1–copular-attributive-objectival→XOLODNO 
–indirect-objectival→IVAN 
 
In this construction, BYT´I.1 acquires additional DSynt-actant III (the Experi-
encer), which comes from its copular objectival attribute — MOŽNO or 
XOLODNO; this DSyntA III is implemented as the dative indirect object of 
BYT´I.1. (For the zero dummy subject, see [Mel’čuk 2006: 477 — 478], and for 
the cop-attr-obj SSyntRel, [Mel’čuk 2015: 92 — 93].) 
3. The lexeme BYT´IV expresses the semantic primitive ‘X is.located.in Y’, 
which specifies the physical spatial coordinates Y of X. BYT´IV is also readily 
used as a support verb with the names of states, processes, etc.: Dom 
ØBYT´IV/byl/budet na stadii zaveršenija ‘The house is/was/will.be on stage 
of.completion’. | Ivan ØBYT´IV/byl/budet v obmoroke ‘Ivan is/was/will.be in 
deep.syncope’. | Ivan ØBYT´IV/byl/budet za nemedlennyj ot´´ezd ‘Ivan is/was/will.be 
for immediate departure’. 
2.3. Not to be confused with 
The following three constructions sufficiently resemble the U Y-a X con-
struction, in particular because they always can be expanded by a preposed 
U→NGEN phrase. However, all the three are communicatively and syntactically 
different from the U Y-a X construction and are excluded from our analysis. 
 
• Qualificative construction 
 
X BYT´I.1 Y ‘X←1–Y‘property’’ [“X has property Y”]: 
Mama sovsem molodaja ‘Mom quite young’. 
 
Adding the U→NGEN phrase to a qualificative construction, we obtain, for in-
stance, (3): 
 
 
  
 
 
(3)  [U Ivana mamaX  ]Sem-T  ØBYT´I.1 sovsem molodajaY ‘At Ivan mom quite  
 
young’ = ‘Ivan’s mom is quite young’. 
 
In (3), the semantic Theme [Sem-T] is ‘Ivan’s mom’. The phrase u Ivana does 
not syntactically depend on BYT´I.1, as it does in the U Y-a X construction, but 
on the noun MAMA ‘mom’, being its Possessor Attribute (see [Iordanskaja, Mel’-
čuk 1995]; for the possessive U N1
GEN N2 construction, see [Крейдлин 1979] 5). 
                                                        
5 Even if this has no direct relation to our topic: among other things, Krejdlin 
[Крейдлин 1979] formulates series of constraints on the use of the U→NGEN as Posses-
sive Attribute, such as the impossibility of the U→NGEN phrase with a noun modified by a 
qualifying adjective: 
(i)  a. Eë glaza sijali ‘Her eyes were shining’. 
~ 
  
 Glaza u neë sijali ‘Eyes at her were shining’. 
Russian U Y-a est´/– X constructions 
17 
In other words, the semantically equivalent phrases u Ivana mama ≡ mama u 
Ivana both mean ‘Ivan’s mom’; such phrases are not considered in this paper. 
 Sentence (4), semantically fairly close to (3), is communicatively and syn-
tactically quite different: 
   
 
 
(4) [U IvanaY]Sem-T ØBYT´II.3 sovsem molodaja mamaX ‘At Ivan quite young  
mom’ ≈ 
 
‘Ivan has a quite young mom’. 
 
Sentence (4) represents the U Y-a X construction. It does not state that Ivan’s 
mom has the property of being very young, but states something about Ivan — 
namely, that he is in the situation of having a quite young mother 6. In (4), the 
semantic Theme of the sentence is ‘Ivan’, while the meaning ‘Ivan’s mom’ is 
part of the semantic Rheme. 
 
• Existential construction 
 
(PREP(loc) Y) BYT´II.1 X ‘(PREP(loc)) Y there.is X’: 
V ètoj kvartire est´ gaz/ljudi ‘In this apartment [there.]is gas [gas cooking]/  
people’. 
 
The U→NGEN phrase can be readily added also to this construction: 
 
 
  
(5)  U Ivana v→kvartire est´→gaz 〈ljudi〉 
 
‘At Ivan in apartment is gas 〈people〉’ = ‘In Ivan’s apartment there is 
gas 〈there are people〉’. 
                                                                                                                                  
 
b.  Eë golubye glaza sijali ‘Her blue eyes were shining’.  ~  
  
 
 
*Golubye glaza u neë sijali ‘Blue eyes at her were shining’. 
The presence of a restrictive modifier does not preclude the U→NGEN as Possessive 
Attribute: 
(ii) Eë levaja ruka drožala ‘Her left hand was trembling’. 
~ 
 
Levaja ruka u neë drožala ‘Left hand at her was trembling’. 
6 The situation with this construction is in fact more complex. If sentence (4) is ne-
gated, the result is the negation of the property ‘being that young’: 
(i)  Nepravda, mat´ u Ivana sovsem ne takaja molodaja  
 
‘Not true, Ivan’s mother is not that young’. 
At the same time, the negation of (ii) produces (iii) or (iv): 
(ii)  U Ivana šikarnaja dača ‘At Ivan luxurious summer.house’. 
(iii) Nepravda, u Ivana net nikakoj šikarnoj dači  
 
‘Not true, at Ivan no any luxurious summer.house’. 
(iv) Nepravda, dača u Ivana sovsem ne takaja šikarnaja  
 
‘Not true, Ivan’s summer.house is not that luxurious’. 
However, it is impossible to discuss here the problem of the scope of negation in the 
constructions under analysis. 
Igor M e l’ č u k  
18 
But in (5), just as in (3), the phrase u Ivana is a Possessive Attribute of kvar-
tira — not our cup of tea. 
 
• Locative construction 
 
X BYT´IV PREP(loc) Y ‘X is.located PREP(loc) Y’: 
Naša mebel´ na čerdake ‘Our furniture in attic’. 
 
Consider sentences (6) with U→NGEN phrases: 
 
(6) a. Naša mebel´ u Ivana na čerdake ‘Our furniture is at Ivan in attic’ = 
‘…in Ivan’s attic’. 
 
b. Naša mebel´ u Ivana ‘Our furniture is at Ivan’s.place’. 
 
c. Naša mebel´ u Ivana, na čerdake ‘Our furniture is at Ivan’s.place, in 
the attic’.  
 
(6a) contains the free phrase U→NGEN ‘at N’, playing the role of a Possessor At-
tribute (‘at Ivan in attic’ = ‘in Ivan’s attic’) — as in (5). (6b) contains the syntac-
tic idiom ˹U→NGEN˺ ‘at N’s place’; this is not the free U→NGEN phrase discussed 
in this paper, but a locative actant of the verb BYT´IV. Finally, (6c) features two 
pseudo-coordinate locative phrases, the first being the syntactic idiom 
˹U→NGEN˺, and the second a semantic elaboration of the first. The idiom 
˹U→NGEN˺ is of course ignored in what follows. Thus, such sentences as U Ivana 
est´ gaz ‘At Ivan’s [there.]is gas’, Maša sejčas u Ivana ‘Masha now at Ivan’s’, 
etc. will not be considered. 
 
NB: The borderline between the existential and the locative constructions is rather 
murky, so that fairly often it is difficult to tell one from the other. However, 
for the present paper, this fact is irrelevant. 
2.4. The importance of the communicative structure 
Both the U Y-a est´/– X constructions are linked in an essential way with the 
semantic-communicative structure [Sem-CommS] of the corresponding utterance. 
On the one hand, the central fact here is as follows: Communicatively, the 
meaning ‘Y’ is always (a part of) the Sem- (and the Synt-)Theme of the sentence 
produced, but syntactically it is realized not as DSynt-actant I of the BYT´ verb 
that controls the U Y-a est´/– X construction. For Russian, the preferred way of 
expressing the Sem-Theme is by DSyntA I (and the SSynt-Subject). However, 
in the U Y-a est´/– X constructions the Sem-Theme ‘Y’ is syntactically imple-
mented not as DSyntA I and the surface subject, but as DSyntA II, turned on the 
surface into an oblique object. For this reason, the lexicographic definitions of 
the BYT´ lexemes that participate in the U Y-a est´/– X constructions are formu-
lated “against the communicative current,” which is normally not done: these 
definitions start not with the Sem-Theme ‘Y’, but with ‘X’, which corresponds 
to DSyntA I, but does not express the Sem-Theme. 
On the other hand, the choice of the surface present tense form est´ of the 
verb BYT´II.3 over its zero form in several cases is conditioned by the Focalized 
character of the meaning involved.

3. The solution 
3.1. Preliminary remarks 
A solution to the problem stated above (the end of Section 1) is based on the 
following two postulates:  
•  The question to be answered is exclusively “How to say this?”, rather than 
“How is this understood?”. Everything linked to the understanding or inter-
pretation of the constructions under analysis is avoided.  
•  The description proceeds from a given meaning to the corresponding 
text(s). The problem of constructing an appropriate meaning for a given 
situation is not discussed. 
 
In addition, two fundamental observations have to be insisted upon. 
 
Observation 1 
All sentences implementing both the U Y-a est´/– X constructions that are 
marked as ungrammatical in numerous publications are in fact syntactically 
and morphologically absolutely correct. What is wrong with them is that they 
express an inappropriate meaning — a meaning that does not correspond to 
the situation being described. 
 
But the production, for a given situation, of a correct linguistic meaning to be 
expressed is not part of a linguist’s preoccupations (we are supposed to only 
deal with а correct expression of a given meaning). 
Here are three hackneyed examples of “ungrammatical” variants of the U Y-a 
est´/– X constructions, accompanied by parallel examples which demonstrate 
that in an appropriate context — that is, corresponding to an appropriate mean-
ing — the problematic expressions are fully grammatical. 
 
(7) a. *U Ivana est´ xorošaja doč´ ‘At Ivan is good daughter’ = ‘Ivan has a 
good daughter’. 
  
b. Dlja ètogo u Ivana est´ xorošaja doč´, kotoruju možno pozvat´ na po-
mošč´ 
 
 
‘For this at Ivan is good daughter, whom is.possible to.call for help’. 
(8) a. *U Ivana est´ gripp ‘At Ivan is flu’ = ‘Ivan has flu’. 
  
b. Razrešenija ujti u Ivana net, zato u nego est´ gripp, na kotoryj on možet 
soslat´sja 
 
 
‘Permission to.leave at Ivan is.not, yet at him is flu, which he can pre-
text’. 
(9) a.  ii(i)  ?U Ivana est´ familija ‘At Ivan is family.name’. 
 
 
i(ii)  *U Ivana familija ‘At Ivan family.name’. 
 
 
(iii)  *U Ivana est´ russkaja familija ‘At him is Russian family.name’.  
 
b.  i (i)  Dlja ètogo u Ivana est´ familija i svjazi 
 
 
 
‘For this at Ivan is family.name and connections’. 
 
 
i(ii)  U vsex svoi problemy, u Ivana — familija 
 
 
 
‘At everybody own problems, at Ivan family.name’. 
Igor M e l’ č u k  
20 
 
 
(iii)  Dlja ètogo u Ivana est´ russkaja familija i pravil´nye znakomstva 
 
 
 
‘For this at Ivan is Russian family.name and right acquaintances’. 
 
Before proceeding, let me insist on the following universally known, but of-
ten forgotten fact: 
 
Generally speaking, the asterisk “ *,” this symbol of ungrammaticality, indi-
cates not only morphological and/or syntactic incorrectness, but marks as 
well linguistic expressions incorrect — i. e. ungrammatical — only with 
respect to a given meaning. 
 
An expression *L̃(‘σ’) either may be incorrect morphologically and/or syn-
tactically, or else it may be morphologically and syntactically perfect, but inap-
propriate for the meaning ‘σ’. It is the latter case that is typical of the ungram-
maticality of the Russian expressions having the U Y-a est´/– X form. In point of 
fact, it proved impossible to find an example where one of the U Y-a est´/– X 
constructions is absolutely ungrammatical: it is only semantically ungrammati-
cal, because it does not correspond to the intended meaning. Create an appropri-
ate context, and this construction turns out fully acceptable. 
 
Next, consider the second fundamental fact. 
 
Observation 2 
The grammaticality of the U Y-a est´/– X constructions is not fully deter-
mined by their lexical “filling”: the meaning and other properties of the ex-
pression X are not crucial, even if they are quite relevant on many occasions 
(all semantically essential properties of possible Xs are considered in [Апре-
сян 2017]). In order to ensure a grammatical use of these two constructions it 
is necessary that the meaning to express and the corresponding verb BYT´ be 
selected in an appropriate way. 
 
The U Y-a BYT´ X constructions differ only by the lexemes of the verb BYT´; 
therefore, our problem can be reduced to the lexicographic descriptions of these 
lexemes BYT´ and the choice of the BYT´ verb corresponding to the given meaning. 
3.2. Lexicographic description of the relevant verbs BYT´ 
3.2.1. S e m a n t i c  c o n t r a s t s  b e t w e e n   
t h e  r e l e v a n t  v e r b s  B Y T ´  
Considering pairs of semantically contrasting sentences with one of the U Y-a 
est´/– X constructions, we can isolate semantic components present in the defini-
tions of the five BYT´. 
 
“Utilitarian” character of BYT´III.1 [Янко 2001] 
Let me begin with sentences (10), where both X and Y are instantiated by 
human proper names; these have no meaning of their own and thus contribute 
nothing to the meaning of the construction: 
 
(10) a. U IvanaY est´BYT´III.1 MašaX ‘At Ivan is Masha’. 
Russian U Y-a est´/– X constructions 
21 
 
b.  U IvanaY Ø BYT´II.5 
MašaX ‘At Ivan Masha’. 
 
 [My ljudi svobodnye, a u Ivana — Maša ‘We are free people while 
Ivan has Masha’.] 
 
Sentence (10a) can be continued … i poètomu on možet mnogo rabotat´ 
〈sovsem ne rabotat´〉 ‘… and therefore he can work a lot 〈not work at all〉’, but the 
continuation ?… i poètomu on vynužden mnogo rabotat´ 〈sovsem ne rabotat´〉 
‘… and therefore he has.to work a lot 〈not work at all〉’ does not sound right: 
in the U Y-a est´ X construction, X is presented as an entity that somehow is 
“usable” by Y, since X enables Y to do what Y is supposed/intends to do. At the 
same time, sentence (10b) readily admits both continuations: it is less specific; 
here, X denotes any situation concerning Y one way or another. The comparison 
of the two sentences allows us to conclude that BYT´III.1 denotes the availability 
of an entity X that is somehow positive for Y, while BYT´II.5 is about a fact X, 
or a situation, that affects Y. (‘Masha’ in (10b) refers to an unspecified situation 
of which Masha is a participant.) This conclusion is corroborated by (11), where 
both X and Y denote inanimates: 
 
(11) a.  U ètoj bajdarkiY est´BYT´III.1 mačtaX ‘At this kayak is mast’. 
 
b. U ètoj bajdarkiY Ø BYT´II.3 
mačtaX ‘At this kayak mast’. 
 
Sentence (11a) can be continued by … tak čto možno ispol´zovat´ parus ‘… 
so that a sail can be used’, but not by ?... tak čto ona ne projdët pod nizkim mo-
stom ‘… so that it won’t pass under a low bridge’; (11b) allows for both con-
tinuations. These observations correspond to Yanko’s statement [Янко 2001: 
310] that the constructions under analysis differ as follows: the U Y-a est´ X 
construction denotes the existence of an entity that is somehow available to Y. 
(Yanko calls this BYT´ “utilitarian.”) In contrast, the U Y-a X construction de-
scribes, in Yanko’s words, “a current phenomenon Х of the world,” to which Y 
is related (in our terms, the situation of which Y is a participant). 
The pairs of sentences in (12)–(13), where the est´ form is used, confirm 
what we already know: 
 
(12) a. U IvanaY est´BYT´III.1 MašaX ‘At Ivan is Masha’. [= (10a)] 
 
b. U IvanaY est´BYT´II.3 vragiX ‘At Ivan is enemies’. 
(13) a. U ètoj bajdarkiY est´BYT´III.1 mačtaX ‘At this kayak is mast’. [= (11a)] 
 
b. U ètoj bajdarkiY est´BYT´II.3 proboinyX ‘At this kayak is holes’. 
 
Both (12a) and (13a) state that there is X available to Y — that is, X “useful” 
for Y; these sentences include BYT´III.1. However, X in (12b) and (13b) X is not 
at all “useful” for Y — this BYT´ is not utilitarian in Yanko’s sense; these sen-
tences contain BYT´II.3, implemented by the est´ variant of its present tense 
form (est´ vragi is obtained by special case 3.2) or 3.3), and est´ proboiny by 
special case 5.2) in the lexicographic entry for BYT´II.3, p. 23). 
The result: the semantic component ‘useful’ has to be introduced into the 
definition of the verb BYT´III.1; the verbs BYT´II.3 and BYT´II.5 do not need this 
Igor M e l’ č u k  
22 
type of component. The contrast of verbs BYT´II.3 vs. BYT´III.1 is well illustrated 
by E. Savvina’s example: 
 
(14) a.  U Ivana vyxodnoj ‘At Ivan day.off’ = ‘It’s Ivan’s day off’. 
 
b. U Ivana est´ vyxodnoj(, čtoby s”ezdit´ k materi) 
 
 ‘At Ivan is day.off to go.see mom’ = ‘Ivan has a day off to go and see 
his mom’. 
 
 “Partial” character of BYT´II.4 [Селивёрстова 1973] 
Sentences in (15) indicate the necessity of the semantic component ‘some of 
[Xs are Z-y]’ in the definition of BYT´II.4: 
 
(15) a.  U IvanaY ØBYT´II.3 sedye volosyX ‘At Ivan white hairs’ =  
 
 
‘Ivan has white hair’ or ‘Ivan has white hairs’. 
 
 
The form volosy is ambiguous between VOLOSY(pl. tantum) ‘[the] hair’ 
and VOLOSPL [‘hairs’]. 
 
b. U IvanaY est´BYT´II.4 sedye volosyX ‘At Ivan is white hairs’ = ‘Ivan has 
some white hairs’. 
 
“Actual” character of BYT´III.2 [Апресян 1995: 523] 
And, finally, the contrast seen in (16) allows us to introduce another seman-
tic component — ‘Y is handling X at the moment of speech or the moment 
specified in speech’; it is covered by the verb BYT´III.2: 
 
(16) a. U IvanaY est´BYT´III.1 nožX 
 
 
  ‘At Ivan is knife’ [somewhere — maybe in his pack or at home]. 
 
b. U IvanaY ØBYT´III.2 nožX  
 
  ‘At Ivan knife’ [in his hand; this sentence is a typical warning]. 
 
Now I am in a position to propose the lexical entries for our five verbs BYT´.

BYT´II.3 ∈ Funci(L(‘X’)) 
 
Comments 
1. ‘X’ denotes a situation — that is, either a fact or an entity inherently in-
volved in a fact. To put it differently, ‘X’ is a predicate or a quasi-predicate, 
while ‘Y’ can be anything: either a (quasi-)predicate or a semantic name: 
U ètogo želanijaY — otčëtlivye konturyX ‘At this desire clear-cut contours’ 
(‘Y’ is a predicate), U ètoj stat´iY mnogo nedostatkovX ‘At this paper many 
Russian U Y-a est´/– X constructions 
23 
drawbacks’ (‘Y’ is a quasi-predicate), or U IvanaY — golubye glazaX ‘At Ivan 
blue eyes’ (‘Y’ is a semantic name). 
2. ‘Y’ is the communicatively dominant node of the Semantic Theme of the 
meaning to be expressed, the rest of this meaning being the Semantic Rheme 
(and maybe the Semantic Specifiers). ‘Y’ plays the same role in all definitions 
of the lexemes BYT´ below. 
3. ρi = 1, 2, 3: U Ivana èkzamen ‘At Ivan exam’ (‘Ivan←1–exam’ or 
‘Ivan←2–exam’: kto1 èkzamenuet kogo2); U Ivana prikaz ‘At Ivan order’ 
(‘Ivan←3–order’: kto1 prikazyvaet čto2 komu3). 
4. The verb BYT´II.3 appears as an element of the value of the lexical func-
tion Funci applied to L(‘X’).

1) U IvanaY na ètu temu est´BYT´II.3/ØBYT´II.3 drugoe mnenieX  
 
‘At Ivan on this topic is/Ø different opinion’. 
2) a. U IvanaY est´BYT´II.3/ØBYT´II.3 prekrasnaja vozmožnost´X pomoč´ nam 
 
 ‘At Ivan is/Ø excellent possibility to.help us’. 
 
b. U IvanaY est´BYT´II.3/ØBYT´II.3 neskol´ko zolotyx koronok  
 
 ‘At Ivan is/Ø several gold crowns’. 
3) U ètix sobytijY est´BYT´II.3/ØBYT´II.3 mnogočislennye svideteliX 
 
‘At these events is numerous witnesses’. 
 
5. ‘X’: either 5.1) X is the desire of Y to perform the corresponding action 
or 5.2) X is a non-inherent particularity of Y 8: 
1) U IvanaY est´BYT´II.3/ØBYT´II.3 (drugoj) voprosX 
‘At Ivan is/Ø (different) question’ [here vopros means ‘the desire to ask a 
question’]. 
                                                        
7 This contrast cannot be described by a purely semantic condition because of the follow-
ing equivalence: 
(i) U IvanaY est´ xarakterX. ≡ (ii) U IvanaY sil´nyj xarakterX ‘At Ivan strong character’; 
in (i), xarakter is XARAKTER1b ‘strong character’, while (ii) contains XARAKTER1a ‘char-
acter’. Several nouns can appear in such pairs: AVTORITET ‘authority’, MOZGI ‘brains’, 
SERDCE ‘heart’, TALANT ‘talent’, VOZMOŽNOST´ ‘possibility’, VYBOR ‘choice’, etc. 
8 The expression “non-inherent particularity” is an abbreviation for a set of several se-
mantemes that must be included in the corresponding definitions to indicate the non-inherent 
character of the property/state/entity in question. For instance: ‘X’s Y-y accent (in Z)’ = ‘Y-y 
mode of pronunciation (of language Z) that X can have’ [John’s British accent in French], 
where the semanteme ‘can’ shows that having an accent is not an inherent particularity of X.

b.  U IvanaY est´BYT´II.3/ØBYT´II.3 mnogo krasnyx rodinokX ‘At Ivan is/Ø many 
red birthmarks’. 
 
Three important caveats 
1. A possibility to use the present form est´ instead of a zero present form in 
a special case does not automatically accrue to all BYT´ lexemes. Thus, BYT´IV 
‘be.located [somewhere]’ does not allow est´ under any circumstances. Therefore, 
this possibility should be lexicographically indicated. 
2. The proposed description of the distribution of the two present tense forms 
of BYT´II.3 (ØBYT´II.3 vs. est´ BYT´II.3) is approximate; it is an attempt at useful gener-
alizations, which I think are possible only partially. 
3. In order to avoid confusion, let me remind the reader that the above condi-
tions for the choice between the forms ØBYT´II.3 vs. est´BYT´II.3 of the lexeme 
BYT´II.3 should not and do not describe the cases of impossibility to combine the 
lexeme BYT´II.3 itself with L(‘X’) — that is, they do not preclude such expres-
sions as *U IvanaY est´/ – dobrotaX ‘At Ivan is/Ø goodness’ = ‘Ivan is good’. 
This is the task for semantic rules that control lexical cooccurrence by means of 
lexical functions (see Subsection 3.3).

Our lexicographic description of the relevant BYT´ verbs can be summarized 
in the following table: 
 
BYT´II.3 :  
“X has Y as its Sem-actant” 
 
U Ivana gripp ‘At Ivan flu’. 
U Ivana est´ vkus ‘At Ivan is

Among these verbs, it is BYT´II.3 that creates all the difficulties; the remain-
ing four BYT´ verbs are quite well-behaved. This is linked to the fact that 
BYT´II.3 does not express a semanteme, as other BYT´ do, but a semantic rela-
tion. This fact buttresses our decision to describe BYT´II.3 “in isolation.” Inter-
estingly, the existence of sentences such as (17) does not force the reunion of 
BYT´II.3 and BYT´II.5 under one lexeme with a disjunctive definition (on dis-
junctive definitions, see [Mel’čuk 2012–2015, II: 324ff]: 
 
(17)  U IvanaY operacijaXʹ i razvodXʹʹ Maši ‘At Ivan surgery and Masha’s di-
vorce’, 
 
where Ivan is a participant of surgery (as a patient or as the surgeon) and is af-
fected by Masha’s divorce, in which he is not a participant. BYT´II.3 and 
BYT´II.5 seem to satisfy the Green-Apresjan Criterion [Mel’čuk 2012–2015, II: 
330–333]. Namely, they appear to be “superposed” and allow the conjoined de-
pendents of both (OPERACIJA ‘surgery’ is coming from BYT´II.3, and RAZVOD 
‘divorce’ from BYT´II.5), without creating a humorous effect (= a pun), as, e.g., 
in She took a lover and two aspirins. However, the lexicographic information for 
BYT´II.3 and BYT´II.5 is very different, and this allows us to keep both lexemes 
apart. Moreover, (17) can be easily interpreted in the sense that the surgery also 
affects Ivan — that is, in the sense of BYT´II.5, which facilitates its acceptance. 
3.3. Semantic rules for the verbs BYT´ in the U Y-a est´/– X constructions 
The next step is the formulation of semantic rules for the verbs BYT´II.3-5 and 
BYT´III.1-2, used in the U Y-a est´/– X constructions. These rules establish corre-
spondences between 
— the starting Sem-structure, which includes one of the following two se-
manteme configurations: 
either ‘X–ρi→Y’ or ‘X←1–σ–2→Y’ | ‘σ’ = ‘affect’/‘be.had’; 
and 
— a corresponding DSynt-tree of the form L(‘X’)←I–L
BYT´–II→L(‘Y’), 
where both lexemes L(‘X’) and L(‘Y’) are nouns, and L
BYT´ is one of the 
five verbs BYT´, described in Subsection 3.2. 
 
Accordingly, there are two major types of semantic rules: 
II.  For the case where the element in the starting Sem-structure to be ex-
pressed is a semantic relation ρi between ‘X’ and ‘Y’: ‘X–ρi→Y’.

pressed is a semanteme ‘σ’ linking ‘X’ and ‘Y’: ‘X←1–σ–2→Y’; this ‘σ’ 
either is ‘affect’ or ‘be.had’ (= Rus. ‘imet´sja’). 
 
Notations 
 
 — ρi: the semantic relation subordinating ‘Y’ to ‘X’ (i = 1, 2, 3, …) 
 — Shading indicates the context of the rule: elements that are not processed 
by the rule, but whose presence is necessary for the rule to apply.

( =  ‘ Y ’  i s  a  S e m - a c t a n t  o f  ‘ X ’ )  
Sem-rules 1 and 2 both express a semantic relation ρi between ‘X’ and ‘Y’. 
Sem-rule 1 covers a common case — the lion’s share of the uses of the U Y-a 
est´/ – X construction, such as U IvanaY zaporX ‘At Ivan constipation’, U IvanaY 
kanikulyX ‘At Ivan holidays’, U IvanaY kurčavye volosyX ‘At Ivan curly hair’, 
U IvanaY zamečatel´naja ženaX ‘At Ivan excellent wife’, U IvanaY est´ xarakterX 
‘At Ivan is character’, etc. 
Sem-rule 2 is foreseen for a particular case, where the noun L(‘X’) is in the 
plural and has a modifier L(‘Z’); then the following contrast is possible (this 
contrast was first brought to the attention of linguists in [Селивёрстова 1973] 
and [Арутюнова 1976: 279–280]: 
 
(18) a.  U IvanaY nepravil´nyeZ ubeždenijaX ‘At Ivan wrong convictions’: 
 
 rather all of Ivan’s convictions are wrong. 
 
b. U IvanaY est´ nepravil´nyeZ ubeždenijaX ‘At Ivan is wrong convictions’: 
 
 some of Ivan’s convictions are wrong. 
 
To ensure the proper application of Sem-rule 2, it is supplied with a special 
condition — “C ”; Sem-rule 1 requires, quite naturally, the condition “non C.” 
 
Sem-Rule 1: The common case 
Sem-rule 1 expresses the semantic relation ρi between ‘X’ and ‘Y’, which 
are both communicatively dominant nodes in their respective semantic-
communicative areas, by the empty lexical-functional (= support) verb Funci.

2)  U IvanaY ØBYT´II.3/*est´BYT´II.3 otpuskX ‘At Ivan leave’ = ‘Ivan is on leave’. 
3) a. U IvanaY ØBYT´II.3/*est´BYT´II.3 sil´nyj xarakterX ‘At Ivan strong character’.

10) U IvanaY ØBYT´II.3/est´BYT´II.3 prikazX ‘At Ivan Ø/is order’. 
 
Most often, ρi = 1, and Func1 is needed; however, the examples 8) and 9) 
demonstrate the case of ρi = 2 (and Func2: ‘svidetel´–2→sobytie’, ‘avtor–
2→tekst’), while the example 10) shows ρi = 3 (and Func3: ‘prikaz–3→Ivan’). 
Only the rule with Funci is given here, since the verbs that are values of two 
other lexical-functional empty verbs (= support verbs) — Operi and Laborij 
— cannot participate in the U Y-a est´/– X constructions for a purely syntactic 
reason: L(‘Y’) must be their syntactic subject, while in the said constructions the 
noun L(‘Y’) is an oblique object of the verb.

it is:

Russian U Y-a est´/– X constructions 
31 
A semantic relation ρi between a (quasi-)predicative semanteme ‘X’ and its 
Sem-actant ‘Y’ is expressed lexically (that is, by a semantically empty support 
verb L(ρi)) if ‘X’ and ‘Y’ are in different Sem-communicative areas — namely, 
‘X’ is in the Sem-Theme and ‘Y’, in the Sem-Rheme. In this case, the needed 
verb is Funci(L(‘X’)), whose syntactic pattern fits the U Y-a est´/– X construc-
tion. As any lexical function, the Funci verb has all elements of its value ex-
plicitly specified in the lexical entry for its keyword, L(‘X’). Note that: 
 — On the one hand, the value of Funci quite often includes verbs different 
from BYT´II.3, BYT´II.4, BYT´III.1 and BYT´III.2: U Ivana imeetsja mnenie  
‘At Ivan there.is opinion’, U Ivana najdëtsja vremja dlja Maši ‘At Ivan 
will.find.itself time for Masha’, Na Ivane ležit vina za požar ‘On Ivan is.lying 
guilt for fire’, Ivanu prinadležit vsja vlast´ ‘To.Ivan belongs all authority’, Ivana 
b´ët oznob ‘IvanACC is.beating [a] chillNOM’ = ‘A chill is.shaking Ivan’, V duše 
Ivana živët nadežda ‘In soul of.Ivan is.alive hope’, Pobeda dostaëtsja Ivanu 
‘Victory comes to.Ivan’, etc. 
— On the other hand, even if BYT´II.3 is possible in the U Y-a X construction 
in most cases where Y is an actаnt of X, this is by no means true in all cases. 
Thus, several names of human qualities and psychological/physiological states — 
such as ŽESTOKOST´ ‘cruelty’, DOBROTA ‘goodness’, NEŽNOST´ ‘tenderness’, 
ČISTOPLOTNOST´ ‘cleanliness’, GNEV ‘anger’, GOLOD ‘hunger’, BOL´ ‘pain’, 
etc. — do not combine with BYT´II.3 in the role of X. In other words, 
Func1(ŽESTOKOST´/DOBROTA/…) = — [no value] (19a); to express the intended 
meaning a different support verb — XVATAT´ — is needed (19b): 
 
(19)  a.  U IvanaY *est´BYT´II.3/*ØBYT´II.3 žestokost´ X  pozvat´ Mašu 
 
 
‘At Ivan *is/*Ø cruelty  to.invite Masha’. 
 
b. U IvanaY xvataet žestokostiX  pozvat´ Mašu 
 
 
‘At Ivan is.enough cruelty to.invite Masha’. 
 
However, this constraint is not purely semantic: thus, such human quality 
noun as SKLONNOST´ ‘propensity’ and illness nouns (which designate physio-
logical states) cooccur with BYT´II.3: 
 
(20) a. U IvanaY est´BYT´II.3/ØBYT´II.3 sklonnost´X k trjukam ‘At Ivan is/Ø pro-
pensity to tricks’. 
 
b. U IvanaY *est´BYT´II.3/ØBYT´II.3 kor´X ‘At Ivan *is/Ø measles’. 
 
There are as well pairs of semantically close nouns such that one accepts 
BYT´II.3 as an element of the value of Funci and the other does not: 
 
(21) a.  U Ivana ØBYT´II.3 prekrasnaja reputacija ‘At Ivan excellent reputation’. 
 
 
vs. 
 
 
*U Ivana ØBYT´II.3 vseobščaja izvestnost´ ‘At Ivan universal renown’. 
 
b.  U Ivana ØBYT´II.3 neprerekaemyj avtoritet sredi studentov 
 
 
‘At Ivan undisputed authority among students’. 
 
 
vs. 
 
 
*U Ivana ØBYT´II.3 rešajuščee vlijanie na studentov  
 
 
‘At Ivan decisive influence on students’. 
Igor M e l’ č u k  
32 
The corresponding constraints seem to be lexical; therefore, Sem-rule 1 is 
necessary. Тhe recourse to Funci and, consequently, to the lexical entries for 
L(‘X’)s effectively solves the problem of choosing the appropriate verb — in 
particular, BYT´II.3 in the U Y-a est´/– X constructions — to express the seman-
tic relation ρi for all cases of ‘Y’ being an actant of ‘X’. 
 
NB: Sem-rule 1 ensures only the choice of the verbal lexeme, in the case that is of in-
terest to us — of BYT´II.3. The choice of the appropriate lex — that is, ØBYT´II.3 
vs. est´BYT´II.3 — is done according to the morphological information in the lexi-
cal entry for BYT´II.3, see Subsection 3.2.2, pp. 23–25. 
 
Sem-Rule 2: The particular case (‘some of Xs [are Z-y]’) 
Sem-rule 2 expresses the semantic relation ρi between ‘X’ and ‘Y’ (as in the 
previous rule, both are communicatively dominant nodes in their respective 
Sem-Comm-areas) plus the semanteme of “partiality” — ‘some of Xs [are Z-y]’ — 
by the verb BYT´II.4. 
 
 
  
1)  a. U IvanaY est´ BYT´II.4 sedyeZ volosyX ‘At Ivan is some white hairs’. ≢ 
 
b. U IvanaY ØBYT´II.3 sedye volosyX ‘At Ivan white hair’. 
2) U IvanaY est´BYT´II.4 nepravil´nyeZ vzgljadyX ‘At Ivan is wrong opinions’ 
[but Ivan also has right opinions]. 
3) U ètogo xramaY est´BYT´II.4 bronzovyeZ dveriX ‘At this temple is bronze 
doors’ [but there also are some other, non-bronze doors].

( ‘ X  a f f e c t s  Y ’  o r  ‘ X  i s . h a d  b y  Y ’ )  
For the Sem-rules 3 and 4 it is irrelevant whether ‘Y’ is or is not a semantic 
actant of ‘X’; they express the semantemes linking ‘X’ and ‘Y’: Sem-rule 3 ex-
presses the semanteme ‘X affects Y’, Sem-rules 4.1-4.2, the semanteme 
‘X is.had by Y’, and Sem-rule 4.3, the semanteme configurations ‘X is.had by Y, 
Y handling Y at moment t0’.

Sem-Rule 3 
Sem-rule 3 expresses the meaning ‘situation (involving) X affects Y’ by the 
verb BYT´II.5. Note that ‘X’ is not the dominant node in the Sem-Rheme.

metonymy is needed: ‘situation←1–involve–2→Y’ ⇔ L(‘Y’).

Sem-rules 4.1–4.2 deal with the semanteme Rus. ‘X imeetsja u Y-a’ ≈ ‘X

4.1 is applied; otherwise, Sem-rule 4.2. As in Sem-rule 3, the meaning ‘X’ is not 
the dominant node in the Sem-Rheme.

Russian U Y-a est´/– X constructions 
35 
Now I am in a position to formulate the solution to the problem stated at the 
end of Section 1: 
 
The semantic rules necessary and sufficient to produce all and only correct 
occurrences of both U Y-a est´/– X constructions are in fact lexicographic 
descriptions of the five lexemes of the verb BYT´ — BYT´II.3-5 and 
BYT´III.1-2. 
 
Note, however, that 100 % accuracy cannot be attained, mainly because of 
the approximate character of our semantic and pragmatic conditions in the mor-
phological zone of the lexicographic entry for the verb BYT´II.3. 
4. Several case studies of the U Y-a est´/– X constructions 
Let me consider several difficult cases involving the two constructions under 
consideration, where various factors intervene and blur the picture. 
 
• Polysemy in Action 
 
Polysemy of L(‘X’) 
 
(23) a. U IvanaY ØBYT´II.3/*est´BYT´III.1 stydX pered Mašej 
 
 ‘At Ivan shame before Masha’ = ‘Ivan is ashamed of Masha’.  
 
b. U IvanaY *ØBYT´II.3/est´BYT´III.1 stydX pered Bogom ‘At Ivan is shame be-
fore God’ = ‘Ivan has the ability to be ashamed of God’. 
 
This contrast is explained by the polysemy of the noun STYD ‘shame’. Sen-
tence (23a) features STYD1 ‘feeling of embarrassment…’ — that is, it speaks of 
an actual psychological state of the person; (23b) contains STYD2 ‘ability to feel 
shame1’. In (23a) the Speaker communicates about Ivan that he is, at this par-
ticular moment, a participant of the concrete situation ‘being.ashamed of 
Masha’, which requires BYT´II.3 (by Sem-rule 1). (23b) tells us about Ivan that 
he has “at his disposal” this particular ability (to be ashamed of God) — that is, 
BYT´III.1 has to be used (Sem-rule 4.2). 
 
Polysemy of the phrase “U + NGEN” 
 
(24) a. U Ivana sejčas ØBYT´IV Maša ‘At Ivan’s now Masha’: Masha is now at 
Ivan’s place. 
 
b. i(i)  U Ivana sejčas est´BYT´III.1 Maša ‘At Ivan now is Masha’: 
 
 
 
Ivan now has Masha “at his disposal” — she enables him to do 
something. 
 
 
(ii) U Ivana sejčas ØBYT´II.3 Maša ‘At Ivan now Masha’: 
 
 
 
Ivan is now affected — positively or negatively — by a situation 
involving Masha. 
 
Igor M e l’ č u k  
36 
(24a) contains the syntactic idiom ˹U Ivana˺ 10 ‘at Ivan’s place’ and the verb 
BYT´IV; in the sentences in (24b) one sees the same constructions as in (24a) 
with BYT´III.1 and (10b) with BYT´II.5, respectively. (Sentences (24a) and (24b-ii) 
are homophonous and cannot be distinguished outside of context.) 
 
• Conversational Implicatures in Action [Grice 1975] 
 
(25) a.  U Ivana est´BYT´III.1 plastikovye lyži (the example is from [Апресян 
1995: 523]) 
 
 
‘Ivan has plastic skis — habitually, that is, not here and not now’: 
 
 
this is so-called “virtual, or permanent, belonging”. 
 
b.  U Ivana ØBYT´III.2 plastikovye lyži 
 
 
‘Ivan has plastic skis — here and now’: this is so-called “actual be-
longing” 11. 
 
This well known contrast makes one think of the semantic component ‘not 
here and not now’ in the definition of BYT´III.1. This, however, would be a 
wrong decision. Sentence (25a) is understood in the sense of “virtual, or perma-
nent, belonging” because of the Gricean Maxim of Quantity: the Speaker is sup-
posed to be as informative as possible; therefore, if he says (25a), with BYT´III.1, 
this entails that he does not mean that Ivan is using his skis here and now — 
otherwise, he would have expressed the actantial link between ‘Ivan’ and ‘skis’ 
(Ivan is actually using the skis), as he does in (25b) by selecting BYT´III.2. 
 
• A Problematic Meaning in Action 
 
  Silly Meaning 
Is sentence (26a) grammatical? 
 
(26) a. U ètogo domaY est´BYT´III.1 dver´X ‘At this house is door’. 
 
Of course, it is, even if it seems funny, while both sentences in (26b) are abso-
lutely normal: 
 
 
b.  i(i) U ètogo doma est´BYT´III.1 dve dveri ‘At this house is two doors’. 
 
 
(ii) U ètogo doma est´BYT´III.1 gigantskaja bronzovaja dver´ 
 
 
 
‘At this house is giant bronze door’. 
                                                        
10 Interestingly, the locative idiom ˹U IVANA˺ ‘at Ivan’s’ has directional and ablative 
versions: ˹K IVANU˺ ‘to Ivan’s’ [Locad(˹U IVANA˺)] and ˹OT IVANA˺ ‘from Ivan’s’ 
[Locab(˹U IVANA˺)]. 
11 Possible continuations for sentences (25a-b): 
(i) U Ivana est´ plastikovye lyži, tak čto on sumeet 〈*ne sumeet〉 katat´sja na ètix 
sklonax 
‘At Ivan is plastic skis, so that he will.be.able 〈*will.not be.able〉 ski on these 
slopes’. 
(ii)  U Ivana plastikovye lyži, tak čto on sumeet 〈ne sumeet〉 katat´sja na ètix sklonax 
 
‘At Ivan plastic skis, so that he will.be.able 〈will.not be.able〉 ski on these slopes’. 
Russian U Y-a est´/– X constructions 
37 
The catch in (26а) is its poor meaning, just like that of its English gloss: what 
indeed is the Speaker communicating when he utters This house has a door? 
Every house has a door, and everyone knows it. But put sentence (26a) in an ap-
propriate context, and it becomes impeccable: 
 
 
c.  U ètogo doma est´BYT´III.1 dver´, kryša, četyre steny — dom kak dom 
‘This house has a door, a roof, four walls — quite an ordinary 
house’. 
 
   Inappropriate Meaning 
 
1) Two friends A and B are together; they need to immediately go to a place 
far away, and A proposes to take B there. In this situation, B can utter any of the 
sentences in (27a). However, if A and B are planning to go somewhere in a 
week from the moment of speech, the first variant in (27b) is more natural: 
 
(27) a. Ponimaju, u tebja est´BYT´III.1/ØBYT´I1I.2 mašina ‘I.see, at youSG is/Ø car’. 
 
b. Ponimaju, u tebja est´BYT´III.1/?ØBYT´I1I.2 mašina ‘I.see, at youSG is/?Ø car’. 
 
The verb BYT´III.2 should not be used in the second situation, since the se-
manteme ‘byt´III.2’ includes the component ‘Y is.handling X at this moment’, 
which makes this meaning inappropriate in the given circumstances. 
2) [The example is from [Мелиг 2004: 438–439]; I adapted it for the purpose 
of this paper.] The Speaker, seeing a fruit in Ivan’s hand (but not quite clearly), 
says (28a); however, if Ivan is not here, he must say (28b): 
 
(28)  a. U Ivana ØBYT´III.2/*est BYT´III.1 jabloko ili gruša ‘At Ivan apple or pear’. 
 
b. U Ivana est BYT´III.1/*Ø BYT´III.2 jabloko ili gruša ‘At Ivan is apple or pear’. 
 
The explanation is straightforward: sentence (28a) expresses the meaning 
“At this moment, Ivan is handling an apple or a pear” and accordingly contains 
the verb BYT´III.2; sentence (28b) expresses the meaning “Ivan has at his dis-
posal an apple or a pear” and contains the verb BYT´III.1. 
 
   Different Meanings of the Phrase L(‘X’)→ADJ/ADV 
 
(29) BYT´II.3 
 
a.  U IvanaY ØBYT´II.3/est´BYT´II.3
Rhem-F akcentX ‘At Ivan Ø/is [foreign] accent’. 
 
b.  U IvanaY ØBYT´II.3 lëgkij 〈sil´nyj〉 akcentX ‘At Ivan slight 〈heavy〉 [foreign] 
accent’. 
 
c.  U IvanaY est´BYT´II.3 lëgkij 〈*sil´nyj〉 akcentX ‘At Ivan is slight 〈*heavy〉 
[foreign] accent’. 
 
Sentence (29a) tells us that Ivan is a non-native speaker, or, formally, that 
‘Ivan’ is a Sem-actant of the situation ‘having an accent’; this warrants the verb 
BYT´II.3, more precisely the form ØBYT´II.3. At the same time, the Speaker may 
insist on this fact — by means of BYT´II.3, which in this case expresses the 
Rhematic Focus; this gives us est´BYT´II.3. However, the equivalence ØBYT´II.3 ≡ 
est´BYT´II.3 does not work in (29b–c): *U IvanaY estBYT´II.3 sil´nyj akcentX ‘At Ivan is 
Igor M e l’ č u k  
38 
heavy [foreign] accent’ is jarring. The reason is pragmatic: it is less natural to 
insist on the fact that somebody has a heavy accent — this is too audible! 
(Or you could say Akcent u Ivana sil´nyj ‘At Ivan accent [is] heavy’.) Therefore, 
in this case using the verb BYT´II.3 to express a Rhematic Focus is unappropriate. 
The same factors are at work in U Ivana est´ temperatura ‘At Ivan is fever’. ~ 
U Ivana est´ nebol´šaja temperatura ‘At Ivan is slight fever’. ~ *U Ivana est´ 
vysokaja temperatura ‘At Ivan is high fever’. (But again with the Rhematic Fo-
cus on est´BYT´II.3 the sentences U IvanaY est´BYT´II.3 sil´nyj akcentX/vysokaja tempera-
turaX are fully grammatical.) 
Another example: 
 
(30) a. U IvanaY est´BYT´III.1/*ØBYT´II. 2 vremjaX ‘At Ivan is/*Ø time’ = ‘Ivan 
has time’. ≡ 
 
b. U IvanaY est´BYT´III.1/ØBYT´II.3 dostatočno vremeniX ‘At Ivan is/Ø enough 
time’. 
 
Sentence (30a) communicates about Ivan that there is the resource ‘time’ 
available to him: the verb must be BYT´III.1. However, if the Speaker starts with 
‘enough 〈much, little …〉 time’, he can keep considering time as an available re-
source and still use BYT´III.1, but he also has the option to present ‘Ivan’ as a 
Sem-actant of the situation ‘having enough 〈much, little …〉 time’ and use 
BYT´II.3: the added quantitative adverb/adjective “drags” Ivan into this situation 
(‘enough 〈much, little …〉 time for Ivan’). As a result, in (30b), both verbs 
BYT´II.3 and BYT´III.1 are licensed. 
 
• Syntax in Action  
 
(31) a. U ètoj židkosti ØBYT´II.3/*est´BYT´II.3 rezkij zapax ‘At this liquid Ø/*is 
strong smell’. 
 
b. U ètoj židkosti *ØBYT´II.3/est´BYT´II.3 zapax ‘At this liquid *Ø/is smell’. 
 
This contrast is taken care of by Sem-rule 1, using Special case 3.1) in Mor-
phology for the verb BYT´II.3. 
5. Equivalence of the U Y-a est´ X and U Y-a X constructions  
There is an additional hurdle in the study of the U Y-a est´/– X constructions: 
the equivalence of both constructions on many occasions. Two cases are to be 
distinguished: either the two constructions are semantically equivalent, or syn-
onymous (have a common Sem-representation), or they are not synonymous, but 
pragmatically equivalent (have different Sem-representations, which correspond 
to the same reality). 
• The two constructions are synonymous, that is, the corresponding sen-
tences — for instance, (32a) and (32b) — have the same Sem-representation, 
shown in (32c):

b. U ètoj stat´i est´BYT´II.3 tri nedostatka ‘At this paper is three drawbacks’. 
 
c.
 
 
 
One sees here the optional variants of the present tense form of BYT´II.3, 
foreseen by Special case 5.2) in the lexicographic entry for this verb (p. 25). 
Another similar case: 
 
(33) a.  U Ivana ØBYT´II.3       durnaja privyčka kovyrjat´ v nosu 
 
   ‘At Ivan bad habit to.pick in nose’. 
 
b. U Ivana est´BYT´II.3 durnaja privyčka kovyrjat´ v nosu  
 
  ‘At Ivan is bad habit to.pick in nose’. 
 
• The two constructions are not synonymous, that is, the corresponding sen-
tences have different Sem-representations. 
Thus, sentences (34a) and (34c) can both be felicitously used in the same 
situation, even if their SemRs, shown in (34b) and (34d), are different. 
 
(34) a.  [ — Tut zaperto. — Ničego,] u Ivana est´BYT´III.1 ključ 
 
  ‘[ — Here locked. — Never mind,] at Ivan is key’: 
 
 (34a) communicates that Ivan has a key at his disposal, no matter 
whether the Addressee sees or does not see it at the moment. 
 
b.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  This SemR is implemented by the verb BYT´III.1.  
 
 
c. [ — Tut zaperto. — Ničego,] u Ivana ØBYT´III.2 ključ. 
 
  ‘[ — Here locked. — Never mind,] at Ivan key’: 
 
 (34c) states that Ivan has a key in his hand (or at least has it immedi-
ately accessible — “here and now”), which he is handling at this 
moment. 
d. 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 Here the verb BYT´III.2 is used.

Sentences (35a) and (35c) behave in the same way; in (35c), the noun DOM

this mafia Ø/is own country’. 
6. Conclusions 
6.1. A practical conclusion 
Dear Alëša, for you the conclusion is fairly simple. Roughly speaking: 
 —  Either you want to communicate that Y is a participant of the situation 
X (in technical terms, ‘Y’ is an actant of ‘X’); then you choose the verb 
BYT´II.3, with its regular zero form ØBYT´II.3 in the present. 
 —  Or you want to communicate that Y has an X at his disposal; then you 
choose the verb BYT´III.1, with its regular est´BYT´III.1 form in the present. 
Barring some less important details, this is an acceptable recipe for dealing 
with the U Y-a est´/– X constructions in Russian. 
6.2. Theoretical conclusions 
1. The choice between the U Y-a est´/– X constructions (i.e., with one of the 
BYT´ verbs) is determined by the meaning to be expressed: roughly, “Y has X at 
Y’s disposal” vs. “Y is a Sem-actant of X”. 
2. The U Y-a est´/– X constructions are described by means of five verbs BYT´: 
— For general cases: 
BYT´II.3, with the default (= unmarked) present tense form ØBYT´II.3 and the 
marked present tense form est´BYT´II.3, 
BYT´II.5, with the present tense form ØBYT´II.3, 
and 
BYT´III.1, with the present tense form est´BYT´III.1.

Russian U Y-a est´/– X constructions 
41 
 —  For particular cases: 
BYT´II.4, with the present tense form est´BYT´II.4 (‘some of Xs are Z-y’) 
and 
BYT´III.2, with the present tense form ØBYT´III.2 (‘Y is handling X at moment t0’) 
3. Both constructions are sensitive to fine semantic distinctions between Xs. 
Thus, we have: 
 
U IvanaY est´BYT´II.3/*Ø BYT´II.3 xarakterX ‘At Ivan is/*Ø character’ = ‘Ivan has a 
strong character’. ~ 
U IvanaY *est´BYT´II.3/Ø BYT´II.3 sil´nyj xarakterX ‘At Ivan *is/Ø strong character’ = 
‘Ivan has a strong character’. 
but 
U IvanaY est´BYT´II.3/Ø BYT´II.3 (novoe) vozraženieX ‘At Ivan is/Ø new objection’. 
 
This difference in behavior is due to the fact that ‘character’ is Y’s permanent 
property, while ‘objection’ in this sentence denotes Y’s desire to perform the ac-
tion of objecting. 
The semantic distinctions laid bare by the U Y-a est´/– X constructions force 
the semanticians to sharpen the whole families of lexicographic definitions; see 
Footnote 8. 
4. The general picture of the U Y-a est´/– X constructions is complicated by 
many-to-many correspondences between the meanings to be expressed and the 
physical forms in the realm of the verbs BYT´. Thus, the same form appears as a 
lex of different BYT´ lexemes: 
Ø 
in BYT´II.3, BYT´II.5 and BYT´III.2; 
est´ in BYT´II.3, BYT´II.4, BYT´III.1 and BYT´III.2. 
On the other hand, different BYT´ forms can express the same meaning, as 
ØBYT´II.3 and est´BYT´II.3: U Ivana (est´) vopros ‘Ivan has a question’; or, at the least, 
they correspond to the same extralinguistic situation, as est´BYT´III.1 and ØBYT´III.2, 
cf. examples (34) and (35). 
5. The choice of the verb BYT´II.3 in the U Y-a est´/– X constructions is lexi-
cally determined by L(‘X’) and has to be described by the lexical function 
Func1(L(‘X’)). 
6. As the next step of this research, other constructions including one of the 
five verbs BYT´ have to be considered — in particular, constructions with loca-
tive phrases, such as V ètoj stat´e est´BYT´II.3/*ØBYT´II.3 nedostatki ‘In this paper 
is/*Ø drawbacks’ vs. V ètoj stat´e est´BYT´II.3/Ø BYT´II.3 rjad nedostatkov ‘In this pa-
per is/Ø number of.drawbacks’, where the use of BYT´II.3 is the same as in the U 
Y-a est´/– X constructions. 
7. The distribution of the present tense forms of BYT´II.3 raises the following 
morphological problem: 
The wordforms est´BYT´II.3 and ØBYT´II.3 are suppletive lexes of the verbal lex-
eme BYT´II.3; however, the conditions for their use include semantic and 
syntactic characteristics of DSynt-actant I (≈ the surface subject) of the verb. 
Is this a typologically normal situation? 
Igor M e l’ č u k  
42 
It is not, even if similar cases — that is, the cases where the choice of an al-
lolex of a given lexeme is determined by another lexeme — are known; for in-
stance: 
— In French, the verb POUVOIR ‘can, be able’: the choice of the allolex puis 
[IND.PRES.1.SG] instead of peux in an inversion (Puis-je vous aider? ‘Can I help 
you?’ vs. *Peux-je vous aider?). 
— In German, the singular genitive with some proper nouns: the allomorph 
-s is used if the noun has no determiner, and the allomorph -Ø if it has (alle 
Mächte Europa+s ‘all powers of.Europe’ vs. alle Mächte des alten Europa+Ø 
‘all powers of.the old Europe’; see the discussion in [Mel’čuk 2006: 402–403]). 
The question remains open about theoretical implications of the existence of 
such allolexes as est´BYT´II.3 and ØBYT´ II.3. 
Acknowledgments 
Thanks a zillion to Lidija Iordanskaja, who worked through several previous ver-
sions of the paper and contributed many essential improvements; her perspicacious 
insistence saved me from several blunders. The subsequent versions underwent the 
scrutiny of V. Apresjan, G. Krejdlin, J. Milićević, E. Savvina, T. Yanko and an anony-
mous reviewer, whose remarks, objections and proposals helped me avoid many an 
obscure, inaccurate and clumsy formulation.
