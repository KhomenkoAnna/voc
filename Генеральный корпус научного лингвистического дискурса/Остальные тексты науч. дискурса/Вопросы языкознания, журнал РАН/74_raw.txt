Abstract: This paper explores how evidentiality is deﬁ ned in recent research. It was inspired by the recent 
publication of The Oxford Handbook of Evidentiality and several other volumes, which provide a rich 
body of new material. The deﬁ nition (or rather demarcation) of evidentiality encompasses both morpho-
syntactic and semantic parameters. I will address criteria for the distinction of dedicated grammatical 
evidentials, and survey the values distinguished in evidentiality’s semantic domain. In addition, I dis-
cuss deictic views of evidentiality, which seem a fruitful approach to the study of evidentials in context.

Аннотация: Эта обзорная статья посвящена понятию эвиденциальности и способам его опреде-
ления в современной лингвистике. Статья была вдохновлена публикацией книги «The Oxford 
Handbook of Evidentiality» и еще нескольких изданий, в которых представлено множество новых 
данных. Определение категории эвиденциальности затрагивает как морфосинтаксические, так 
и семантические параметры. В статье обсуждаются критерии выделения грамматических пока-
зателей эвиденциальности и конкретные значения, входящие в эвиденциальную семантическую 
зону. Кроме того, уделяется внимание недавним работам, в которых данная категория рассма-
тривается как дейктическая, что кажется удачным подходом к изучению эвиденциальных пока-
зателей в контексте коммуникативной ситуации.

Introduction
Research on evidentiality, or the linguistic encoding of information source, has grown expo-
nentially in recent years. Grammatical forms referring to a type of information source are men-
tioned as early as the 4th century BCE, in Pāṇini’s grammar of Sanskrit [Friedman 2018: 125], 
and they surface in descriptions of a variety of languages throughout history. The idea of a dis-
tinct grammatical category with this function, however, is relatively new.1 Evidentiality became 
an established concept in linguistics only during the past two to three decades, which have been 
especially proliﬁ c in terms of qualitative descriptions and new theoretical and empirical ap-
proaches. A quick search of the keyword “evidentiality” on Google Scholar learns that in the 
period between 2000 and 2009 a total of 4 330 publications appeared, and another 11 300 be-
tween 2010 and 2019 (in contrast: only 941 publications are retrieved for the period 1990–1999).2 
Nonetheless, some issues regarding the deﬁ nition and delimitation of evidentiality as a linguis-
tic concept persist. In the present paper I explore how evidentiality is deﬁ ned in contemporary 
studies. This concerns the morphosyntactic phenomena associated with the category, as well 
as the speciﬁ c values composing its semantic domain (e.g. sensory perception, inference, hear-
say). Additionally, evidentials can be deﬁ ned in terms of their relationship to a discursive context.
The paper was inspired by the recent publication of The Oxford Handbook of Evidentiality 
[Aikhenvald (ed.) 2018] along with two other new volumes: Epistemic Modalities and Eviden-
tiality in Cross-Linguistic Perspective, edited by Zlatka Guentchéva, and Evidence for Eviden-
tiality, edited by Ad Foolen, Helen de Hoop and Gijs Mulder. The Oxford Handbook is intended 
as a reference work that provides an up-to-date state of the art in the study of evidentiality. The 
papers in [Foolen et al. (eds.) 2018] are proceedings of a workshop held in Nijmegen (the Neth-
erlands) in 2014, and the volume edited by Guentchéva [2018] is a successor to L’énonciation 
médiatisée [Guentchéva (ed.) 1996], and L’énonciation médiatisée II [Guentchéva, Landabaru 
(eds.) 2007]. All three volumes focus on empirical evidence and provide a wealth of new ma-
terial. The Oxford Handbook consists of 21 chapters dealing with evidentiality in speciﬁ c lan-
guages or groups of languages. The remaining 15 chapters provide overviews of more general 
topics, such as the interaction of evidentiality with other categories, evidentiality in experimen-
tal research and in formal semantic theories, cultural pragmatics, and evidentials in language 
contact. The volumes edited by Guentchéva and Foolen et al. contain, among other things, cor-
pus-based studies of particular languages, and theoretical considerations. As Aikhenvald is the 
main proponent of a strictly grammatical interpretation of the term “evidentiality”, The Oxford 
Hanbook focuses on grammatical evidentials. The other two volumes adhere to a more inclu-
sive, functional approach, which views evidentiality as a universal semantics that can be real-
ised with various means. Functional approaches overall are more common, in particular among 
researchers of European languages, which lack evidentiality as a grammatical category. Thus, 
the introductory paper to a thematic issue of the Journal of Pragmatics was paradoxically enti-
tled: Evidentiality in non-evidential languages: Are there evidentials in Spanish? [Albelda Marco 
2015]. At the same time, evidentiality gained recognition as a distinct grammatical category. It 
has become a common addition to the TAM triad, cf. The grammaticalization of tense, aspect,

in [Aikhenvald 2004: 11–17].
 
2 The search query was made on 06.04.2019. It should be kept in mind that Google Scholar’s search en-
gine does not offer a 100 % coverage of existing literature. In addition, the term “evidentiality” also 
occurs in other disciplines, such as philosophy. As a matter of fact, of the handful of results from the 
period before 1960, none are on linguistics. I assume that the exponential growth of studies on eviden-
tiality from the 2000s onwards is due to the surge in popularity of evidentiality in linguistics, but I did 
not make a detailed study of these search results.

modality and evidentiality [Hengeveld et al. 2017], and Tense, aspect, modality and evidential-
ity: Cross-linguistic perspectives [Ayoun et al. (eds.) 2018].
Regardless of the opposing preliminaries, most scholars would agree that the study of both 
grammatical and non-grammatical (including lexical and semi-grammatical) expressions contrib-
utes to our understanding of evidentiality, although dedicated grammatical forms should be dis-
tinguished from lexical expressions and contextual interpretations. Section 1 presents an overview 
of the terminology used in the present paper. Section 2 evaluates some criteria for distinguishing 
different types of marking. In Section 3 I investigate the speciﬁ c values associated with evidential-
ity, and whether empirical data warrant some revisions in the semantic domain. Evidentials in gen-
eral can be construed as deictic. Section 4 explains how to do this and which advantages it has 
for language-speciﬁ c and comparative analyses. Section 5 explores experimental evidence for the 
cognitive mechanisms involved in identifying information source, and how they relate to linguis-
tic structure. Evidentials are highly context-sensitive items. Some interesting perspectives on how 
discursive context inﬂ uences their use are the topic of Section 6, in which I also address some 
methodological implications. Section 7 summarises the main conclusions of the preceding sections.
1. Preliminaries and terminology
For clarity, I adopt the convention of capitalizing language-speciﬁ c categories while writing 
comparative concepts with lower case letters. Below I specify the concepts I will use throughout 
this paper. Equivalents used by other authors are indicated between brackets. Since most stud-
ies treat “evidentiality” as a universal semantics, I use this term to refer to the linguistic encod-
ing of information source in a ����� sense. The noun “evidential” is reserved for grammatical 
expressions only, following the lead of Anderson [1986: 274]. Information sources are divided 
into types, which are rendered as adjectives here. Together with “information” they character-
ize a type of information source, e.g. “visual information” is information obtained through vi-
sual perception. In combination with “evidential” they refer to a grammatical morpheme with 
a speciﬁ c function; a “visual evidential” is a grammatical morpheme dedicated to marking in-
formation obtained through visual perception.
Evidentiality 
—  a semantic-functional category for the encoding of information 
source
Evidential (adjective) — expressing information source, e.g. “evidential strategy”
Evidential (noun) 
— grammatical form used to mark information source
Direct 
— personally witnessed (ﬁ rsthand)
Indirect 
— not personally witnessed (non-ﬁ rsthand) 3
Visual 
— seen
Auditory 
— heard sound (not speech)
Non-visual sensory 
— any type of sensory perception besides visual
Participatory 
— active participation
Revelative 
— witnessed in a dream
Inferential 
— inference based on a visual result or traces (deduction)
Presumptive 
—  inference based on some prior knowledge and/or chain of reason-
ing (assumed, conjecture)
Reportative 
— hearsay from an unidentiﬁ ed source 
 
3 In my view, indirect is not an equivalent of Indirective, Mediative or Non-conﬁ rmative, contra Aikhenvald 
(cf. the glossary provided in [Aikhenvald (ed.) 2018: 40–43]). See Section 2 of this paper for more detail.

2. Isolating grammatical evidentials
As mentioned in the introduction to this paper, evidentiality can be viewed as a grammatical 
category or a universal semantics. The latter is especially popular among researchers of European 
languages that lack the grammatical category. Aikhenvald is a well-known opponent of treat-
ing evidentiality as a semantic-functional category, in part because functional approaches tend 
to extend the term to cover any type of expression related to knowledge. Aikhenvald character-
ised the tendency to analyse phenomena from familiar European languages in terms of some 
“exotic” category like evidentiality as a fad.
 
“This is similar to how, a few years back, when ergativity was in ‘vogue’, languages which 
have ambitransitive verbs of type S=O (e.g. English I broke the glass and The glass broke) 
were analyzed as ‘ergative’ ” [Aikhenvald 2003: 19]
Many languages, however, feature forms that are in the process of grammaticalisation. Some 
of them are interpreted as grammatical evidentials in the typology of Aikhenvald (such as the 
auxiliary ‘ﬁ nd’ from the East Caucasian language Bagvalal [Aikhenvald 2004: 155], though com-
pare the treatment of this construction in [Daniel, Maisak 2018]). Aikhenvald dismisses other 
forms, such as German modal verbs, as “evidential strategies”: forms that indicate information 
source in context, but have one or more other meanings. German sollen ‘should, must’ can have 
reportative meaning as in example (1), but remains a modal verb in other contexts.
(1) 
G����� [Vanderbiesen 2018: 174]
 
Die Schienenfreunde sollen  Champagner für 250 Euro die Flasche bevorzugt haben.
 
(FNP/12–09/4)
‘The railway colleagues are said to have preferred champagne of €250 the bottle.’
Separating grammatical information source marking from other ways of expressing the same 
meaning presupposes a deﬁ nition of what is grammatical and what is evidential. Aikhenvald 
[2004: 38] proposes that, to qualify as a grammatical evidential, a form should have information 
source marking as its “main meaning”. By this criterion, grammatical evidentials can be sepa-
rated from evidential strategies. Isolating the main meaning of a form is left to the subjective in-
terpretation of researchers of speciﬁ c languages, which might lead to contradictory evaluations, 
as I will discuss below. Aikhenvald additionally deﬁ nes “grammatical” in contrast to lexical 
as dealing with “closed systems, which can be realized by bound morphemes, clitics and words 
which belong to full grammatical classes, such as prepositions, preverbs or particles” [Ibid.: 11]. 
A closed system in Aikhenvald’s framework may consist of an evidential on one hand, and an un-
marked term on the other, where unmarked terms represent varying degrees of neutrality in dif-
ferent languages [Aikhenvald 2018: 15–16]. Kronning [2018] argues that Reportive Conditionals 
(RC) in Romance languages are grammatical expressions of evidentiality. His argument is based 
on the RC’s morphemic status as ﬂ ectional sufﬁ xes, and their systematic opposition to a neutral 
 
 Samira Verhees 
117
paradigm of indicative forms [Ibid.: 73–74]. This would characterise them as evidentials accord-
ing to Aikhenvald’s criteria. In addition, Kronning rejects the idea that the evidential function is 
a mere “contextual interpretation” of the conditional, suggesting that they also satisfy the “main 
meaning” criterion. However, the analysis does not address how the evidential function of RC’s 
relates to their conditional function in terms of the contexts where one or the other is used.
Cornillie et al. [2015] advocate a broader approach based on Boye & Harder’s [2012] us-
age-based theory of grammatical status. According to this theory, lexical items contribute discur-
sively primary information, while grammatical items have an ancillary function. Thus the mean-
ing of a grammatical item cannot constitute the main communicative point of an utterance. Sim-
ilarly, Anderson [1986: 274] proposed that evidentials in particular “are not themselves the main 
predication of the clause, but are rather a speciﬁ cation added to a factual claim about something 
else”. From this point of view, matrix or parenthetical clauses with verbs of speech or percep-
tion are not evidentials, but certain types of adverbs are [Cornillie et al. 2015: 3]. This approach 
allows for more consistent judgments regarding forms in evolution and elements of ambiguous 
morphosyntactic status, although it does not solve the semantic puzzle.
Clearly delimited notional deﬁ nitions of evidential semantics are necessary to avoid interpret-
ing as “evidential” any construction associated with the knowledge of the speaker that shows 
some signs of grammaticalisation on a morphosyntactic level. A case in point is de Hoop et al. 
[2018], who set out to prove that the ﬁ rst person matrix clause ik denk ‘I think’ in Dutch is an in-
cipient grammatical evidential denoting inference. Inferentiality is deﬁ ned as referring to situ-
ations when “the speaker can infer from certain contextual clues  or when they assume for 
one reason or another ” [de Hoop et al. 2018: 78]. As a matter of fact, the construction re-
fers to a certain view of reality held by the speaker, in line with the lexical meaning of denken 
‘think’. Inference is a contextual interpretation projected on the examples by the authors. This 
becomes especially clear in the case of the supposed “past inferentials” [Ibid.: 89–91].
(2) 
ik   dacht    dat   jullie   er     rond   1   uur   wel    zouden   zijn
I    thought   that   you.��   there   round   1   hour   ����   would     be
‘I thought you would have arrived by one.’
In this example, the speaker held a view that some people would have arrived around one, 
but this turns out to be untrue. Their initial view could be based on inference from prior knowl-
edge and reasoning (i.e. presumptive, a speciﬁ c type of inference). Perhaps they agreed to meet 
around one and the guests in question are usually punctual, hence, the speaker infers that the 
guests will have arrived by one. Another possible scenario is that someone called the speaker 
to inform them of their guests’ estimated time of arrival, in which case the source is reportative. 
The point is that the construction simply does not specify where the speakers’ view came from, 
which is rather far removed from any notional deﬁ nition of evidentiality based on information 
source, that is, how the speaker acquired the information.
Other types of clauses with complement-taking verbs do convey an evidential meaning, such 
as ik zie dat ‘I see that’, which can be interpreted in context as ‘I infer based on some visual evi-
dence’ [de Hoop et al. 2018: 77–78]. The inferential reading of this construction arises as a con-
versational implicature, which is a common mechanism for the development of evidential func-
tions. Another well-known example of this process is the path from resultative or perfect to in-
ference (see [Bybee et al. 1994: 51–105]). Increasing conventionalisation of the evidential read-
ing can result in a dedicated grammatical expression, although it is not quite clear how to eval-
uate forms situated in different stages of the intermediate process.
In addition, evidentiality rarely comes alone. A form with an evidential meaning may also 
express epistemic modality (i.e. speaker certainty and commitment regarding the truth value 
of information [Boye 2012: 1–6]) and/or mirativity (indicating that the information is some-
how new or unexpected, or “not yet integrated into [the speaker’s] overall picture of the world” 
[DeLancey 1997: 36]. These meanings can be contextual variants, or they may arise simulta-
neously. What remains unclear, is how to identify the “main meaning” among them, in order 
118

to determine to which category the marker in question belongs and consequently, whether it is 
an evidential or not. This results in contradictory accounts for general indirect forms in particular.
General indirect forms tend to be semantically diffuse. First, because they combine inferen-
tial and hearsay readings. The exact reading in a given situation should thus be retrieved from 
the context. Consider the following example from Komi-Zyryan.
(3) 
K���-Z����� [Leinonen 2000: 427]
 
Asylnad    kor    kytšoltim,    lys-vatö   völi    kysköma.       Sijö    völöma      oš.
morning.in   when   run.1���.1��   dew-���   ���    shake.2���.3��    it      ���.2���.3��   bear
 
Seni   i       kujlö        völöm       potšos   doras   tsökyd   inas.
there   ����   lie.����.3��   ���.2���.3��   fence     by      dense     place.in
‘In the morning, as we were running around, the dew had dried. It turned out that it was 
a bear. There it had been lying by the fence in the thicket.’
In this case, the Second Past form völöma ‘was’ indicates inference: the speaker inferred the 
information (‘it was a bear’) based on animal tracks they had seen. In another context, the same 
form could indicate that the relevant piece of information was based on hearsay.
Second, indirect forms can be used to indicate a more abstract kind of distance between 
an event and a speaker, which can have a mirative or epistemic modal ﬂ avour, as is the case with 
verb tenses with a non-attributivised auxiliary, or NAFs (which are paradigmatically opposed 
to those with an attributivised auxiliary) in the East Caucasian language Tsakhur.
 
“The distribution of NAFs deﬁ nitely correlates with that of genuine markers of non-at-
tested evidence and mirativity. At the same time, assuming that the meaning of NAFs is 
restricted to “inferred evidence”, “reported evidence”, and “unexpected information” does 
not allow one to account for the whole range of their uses. Our claim is that NAFs have 
a more general function, namely, that of showing the speaker’s distancing, or detachment 
from the event referred to.” [Maisak, Tatevosov 2007: 391]
Researchers of areally contiguous languages make similar observations. Indirect past tenses 
are an areal feature of a large belt that stretches across the Eurasian continent. This area forms one 
of the main evidential areas in the world [Plungian 2010: 19–23]. Evidentiality in this part of the 
world is special because specialists of individual languages prefer not to call it evidentiality at all. 
Lazard [1999] proposed the term “mediative” for this type of markers in Turkish, Persian and Ta-
jik, and in the study of Turkic languages, “indirective” is commonly used for the same purpose (see 
[Johanson 2018] inter alia). According to Friedman, the main function of indirect pasts in several 
languages of the Balkans and the Caucasus is to mark “non-conﬁ rmativity”, i.e. the speaker does 
not vouch for the truth of the information [Friedman 2000]. As Friedman demonstrates, unvouched 
for information often (but not necessarily) coincides with information acquired indirectly. Gen-
erally speaking, the evidential interpretation of Eurasian indirect forms tends to dissipate in light 
of detailed semantic analyses of their usage, as in Golosov & Kozlov’s [2018] analysis of past 
tenses in Hill Mari. Still, some authors prefer to view non-evidential meanings of indirect forms 
as “extensions” or “overtones”: meanings that arise in addition to a central evidential meaning, 
see e.g. [Brosig, Skribnik 2018] on Mongolic or [Skribnik, Kehayov 2018] on Uralic languages.
Amidst these contrasting points of view, it remains unclear how the status of competing and 
co-occurring meanings can be established and compared. Nevertheless, many researchers as-
sume that indirect forms are uncontroversial examples of grammatical evidentiality. A famous 
case is Turkish, which features in the bulk of research on the acquisition and cognitive effects 
of grammatical evidentiality (see overviews in [Ünal, Papafragou 2018] and [Fitneva 2018]). 
Compare this to Johanson’s recent characterization of Turkic indirect forms below.
 
“Indirectivity markers do not ﬁ t into evidential schemes distinguishing between ‘the speak-
er’s non-ﬁ rsthand and ﬁ rsthand information’. Their primary task is not to express the ex-
ternal origin of the addresser’s knowledge.” [Johanson 2018: 512]
 
 Samira Verhees

If Johanson’s claim is true, Turkic languages lack grammatical evidentiality according 
to Aikhenvald’s “main meaning” criterion. Note also that many languages feature portmanteau 
morphemes with multiple meanings of equal status, such as evidentiality and tense (see [Forker 
2018]), or evidentiality and spatial deixis (e.g. [Jacques 2018]). Such combinations are possible 
because the semantic domain of evidentiality is adjacent to or even overlaps with those of other 
categories. Plungian [2010: 46] situates presumptives (inference based on prior knowledge and/
or reasoning) at the intersection of evidentiality and epistemic modality, because they inherently 
contain an assessment of what is likely to be the case. As a result, it is not quite clear what can 
qualify them as evidentials in a given case. Paradigmaticity cannot resolve these kinds of prob-
lems, since evidentials are often “scattered” across the grammar of a language (cf. [Aikhenvald 
2003: 8–11] on scattered coding), and they may share a paradigm with exponents of other cate-
gories, such as mood sufﬁ xes (see [Usenkova 2015] on Samoyedic) or egophoric markers (see 
[Tournadre, LaPolla 2014] on Tibetic).
3. Composition of the semantic domain
This section focuses on the speciﬁ c meanings subsumed under the concept of evidential-
ity. Existing accounts depart from a notion of evidentiality as a grammatical category marking 
information source. Consequently, the semantic domain is constructed based on the presence 
of grammatical expressions. Each meaning associated with information source that is marked 
with a distinct grammatical morpheme in some language becomes part of the domain. Similar 
meanings are grouped under generalised labels. The table below compares three different ac-
counts. Bold indicates signiﬁ cant differences. Non-bold terms occupying the same row in the 
table refer to the same value, regardless of the variation in terminology.

All three authors maintain a division of direct vs. indirect source types. This is licensed by the 
presence of general direct and indirect forms in certain languages. Direct information typically 
covers any type of sensory evidence. Visual perception can be distinct from the other senses. 
Willett’s taxonomy implicates the possibility of a language that marks both visual and auditory 
perception separately from the other senses. To my knowledge this is attested only in the Po-
moan language Kashaya [Oswalt 1986]. Other languages single out auditory perception as op-
posed to unmarked terms (e.g. Yuchi, an isolate of Oklahoma [Linn 2000]). The Auditives (au-
ditory evidentials) attested in Samoyedic languages also cover other types of non-visual sensory 
perception, as well as internal sensations, according to Usenkova [2015: 183]. There is no ev-
idence for dedicated evidentials marking olfactory, gustatory or tactile perception [Aikhen-
vald 2018: 13]. Southern Nambikwara has an Internal Support Evidential for information de-
rived from a speaker’s “gut feeling”, according to Lowe [1999], but this requires veriﬁ cation 
(cf. [Eberhard 2018: 336–341]).
Jakobson referred to direct information as “memory evidence” [1984: 46]. In case of past 
events, “memory evidence” is perhaps psychologically more accurate than “direct visual evi-
dence”. Humans are not recording devices, and our memory has a distorting effect on sensory 
input (see also Section 5 of this paper). We remember some events vividly and in great detail, 
while of other events, we might wonder whether and how they took place, even when we know 
at some level that we witnessed them. Interestingly, the evidential system in Taku Tibetan en-
codes the quality of observation. The Immediate Evidential marks instantaneous observations, 
whereas the Direct Evidential is appropriate after prolonged observation, according to Sun “lead-
ing to assured knowledge of the event” [Sun 2018: 51–54].
Plungian adds participatory evidence to the direct subdomain. Participatory evidentials mark 
situations in which the speaker actively participated (as opposed to merely having witnessed 
an event). They are attested in Pomo and New Guinean languages [Plungian 2010: 34]. Tibe-
to-Burman languages feature egophoric markers, which are deﬁ ned similarly as marking infor-
mation the speaker has unique access to, such as their own internal states and volition [Sun 2018: 
49]. In case the speaker was not the one who slapped the other person in example (4) below, 
a Direct (Sensory) evidential would be used instead of the Egophoric lə which is employed here.
(4) 
T��� T������ [Sun 2018: 49]

1��:���   3��.���   slap꞊�����       do:����-���
‘I gave him a slap in the face.’
The use of Egophoric markers can be extended to mark events where not the speaker but 
someone close to them participated [Sun 2018: 55–56]. In situations over which the speaker has 
no control, a Direct (Sensory) Evidential is used instead of the Egophoric marker [DeLancey 
2018: 591–592]. Egophoricity does not necessarily form part of an evidential system, and can be 
considered a category in its own right (see [Floyd et al. 2018]). DeLancey [2018: 584] charac-
terises the Tibetic egophoric system as follows: “Rather than an evidential category, Egophoric 
is a category to which evidentiality is not applicable.” In other words, Egophoric markers refer 
to a speciﬁ c type of personal knowledge that exempts the speaker from specifying information 
source with an evidential. An argument in favour of such an interpretation is the possible ex-
tension of participatory marking to situations where someone close to the actual speaker partic-
ipated, suggesting it is a more general marker of personal evidence. Nonetheless, cases where 
it marks the speaker’s participation are consistent with a deﬁ nition of evidentials as referring 
to a participant’s information source, such as their own volitional action and internal state in con-
trast with visual perception.
General indirect markers cover inference and hearsay. Inferred information constitutes a fairly 
uncontroversial subdomain. Inference from visible results or consequences (inferential) is dis-
tinct from inference based on prior knowledge and reasoning (presumptive), although a single 
form may cover both meanings. The appropriate context for their use may vary across languages.

Recall example (3) from Komi-Zyryan, where a speaker inferred that ‘it was a bear’ based on bear 
tracks they saw. Bear tracks are not a direct result of the action denoted by the verb — they are 
an obvious consequence identiﬁ ed by the speaker. The use of an inferential in such a case re-
quires that the speaker knows what bear tracks look like. As discussed in [Tatevosov 2003], one 
person’s obvious consequence might be another person’s wild guess, depending on their prior 
knowledge. Cross-linguistically, inferentials pattern with hearsay (and thus indirect) most fre-
quently,4 but they can also combine with sensory evidence (see [Brugman, Macauly 2015: 206] 
on Karuk). Inference based on results occupies an intermediate position between direct and in-
direct, since it implies that the speaker or “origo” witnessed at least part of the event they are 
talking about.
Information from other people’s verbal reports can be second-hand or third-hand, according 
to Willett’s classiﬁ cation. Second-hand information is based on a report from an eye-witness, 
while third-hand is based on a report of a report. Eberhard describes a Reported Thirdhand sufﬁ x 
(-sĩn-) in addition to a distinct Reported Secondhand (-satau-) sufﬁ x for Mamaindê [Eberhard 
2018: 349–350]. The presence of two distinct morphemes for each of these meanings seems to be 
cross-linguistically rare. A folklore marker is attested only in the now extinct Athabaskan lan-
guage Tonkawa. Hoijer described a Quotative Sufﬁ x -lakno’o, which was obligatory in reported 
narratives and existed alongside a general Quotative Sufﬁ x -no’o [Hoijer 1933: 105–106]. The 
fact that all of these functions are attested with distinct markers at least in one language licenses 
their inclusion in the domain, although they should probably be subsumed under Aikhenvald’s 
reportative and quotative categories as more speciﬁ c subtypes.
Quotatives render a quotation ascribed to a discrete source, while reportatives indicate that 
a statement is based on hearsay, without specifying a source [Aikhenvald 2004: 64]. Examples 
(5) and (6) from Botlikh illustrate a Reportative and a Quotative Particle, respectively.

‘[He] said that he has no money.’
The Reportative Particle χʷata in (5) indicates that the proposition ‘a cow fell down’ is based 
on hearsay. The Quotative Particle talu in example (6) marks the boundary of a quotation — 
‘I have no money’ — attributed to a certain male person.5 The main distinctive feature of quo-
tatives is their identiﬁ cation of a discrete source, but this criterion is not met by all quotatives. 
The Botlikh Quotative can reproduce an utterance from the perspective of the addressee and 
omit any reference to a source, as in (7).

Even in a situation where a quotative does introduce a source, it renders a construction that 
is different from other evidentials in terms of its communicative function. Evidentials determine 
a type of information source and as such, refer to how a speaker acquired certain information. 
Quotatives, on the other hand, mark a quotation, which can be a repetition of one’s own words, 
 
4 This means that a single marker expresses both meanings.

a verbalisation of thoughts, or even an imagined utterance (see also [Holvoet 2018] on “echoic” 
use of quotative constructions). They refer to a type of information source only by extension. 
Boye [2010] dismisses the idea that quotatives are evidentials based on their scope properties 
in comparison to reportatives and other evidentials.
General knowledge is not recognised as a distinct value in any of the approaches summarised 
in Table 1, though Plungian adds “common knowledge” as a secondary meaning to both partici-
patory evidence and presumptive.6 Mamaindê features a General Knowledge Evidential, mark-
ing “information that is known to the whole community, either because it is habitual, or because 
it is part of their mythological lore” [Eberhard 2018: 350]. A dedicated marker is also attested 
in Lamjung Yolmo [Gawne 2014: 87]. Example (8) below shows the General Fact Copula in a ge-
neric statement that cannot be traced to a speciﬁ c information source.

DeLancey [2018: 587–589] analyzes Tibetic Factual markers as forms that indicate the ab-
sence of a speciﬁ c source, rather than factual or general knowledge, which is supported by their 
use in neutral contexts. Stating general facts is thus not their main function, but simply the most 
common context for their use. General knowledge is often cast in a neutral or the least marked 
form available. This is the case in the East Caucasian language Hinuq. Hinuq has Unwitnessed 
Past tenses, which are opposed to Neutral Pasts with direct evidential overtones; the latter are 
employed for “encyclopaedic knowledge” [Forker 2014: 54]. Traditional narratives, including 
stories about the history of the village, are told using Unwitnessed forms. Another value not 
mentioned in the accounts presented in Table 1, is information from dreams (or “revelative”). 
Boas [1911: 496] described a special sufﬁ x for this purpose for Kwakiutl, although he does not 
provide much detail on how it is used.
To sum up, participatory evidentials in my view deserve a place in evidentiality’s semantic 
domain. Quotatives on the other hand, do not, cf. also Anderson’s [1986: 284] semantic maps 
of evidentiality, where quotatives are adjacent to, but not part of evidentiality’s semantic do-
main. General knowledge is marked with a separate morpheme at least in Mamaindê, which li-
censes its recognition as a distinct value. The same applies to second-hand and third-hand re-
portatives, albeit as subtypes of reportative, and perhaps also to folklore, depending on whether 
the Tonkawa Quotative for narratives is a reportative or a quotative marker. Revelative is an-
other possible distinction.
4. Evidentials as deictic
Evidentials can be construed as deictic because they specify an information source from the 
perspective of a speech event participant (usually the speaker). As such, they are determined 
by the context in which they are used, similar to e.g. tense marking or personal pronouns. In other 
words, evidentials are indexical, or “shifters” in the terminology of Jakobson [1984]. In deictic 
approaches, evidentials implicate three events: an original event, an event where a speaker ac-
quired information about this event, and a speech event.7 Evidential speciﬁ cations determine the 
 
6 Note that the marking of general knowledge should not be confused with the marking of inference based 
on general knowledge (i.e. presumptive).
 
7 The reference point or origo for an evidential expression is typically the speaker. In questions, this can 
be the addressee (though this “interrogative ﬂ ip” does not occur in all languages, cf. Murray [2017: 
43–50]). Some languages allow for embedded evidentials.

relationship between the original event and the speech event. They render a sort of “metapropo-
sition” that scopes over a proposition and remains discursively backgrounded (see [Evans et al. 
2018] on evidentials as metapropositional operators). Additionally, the various relationships em-
bodied by speciﬁ c evidentials can be ranked on a cline in terms of their proximity to a deictic 
centre, parallel to other deictic categories, e.g. proximal — medial — distal for spatial deixis, 
direct — inference — hearsay for evidentiality.
Several recent studies explore the idea of evidentials as deictic. Not all of them explicitly 
refer to evidentials as deictic, but they construe their function in a similar fashion as outlined 
above.8 Murray, for example, deﬁ nes evidentiality as a type of not-at-issue content from the 
point of view of formal semantics, and describes the relation contributed by evidentials as an ev-
idence base, which links an evidence holder to a proposition [Murray 2017]. Relational theo-
ries within formal semantics introduce the notion of Evidence Acquisition Time as an interme-
diary between a speech event and a proposition, to account for parallels between tense-aspect 
and evidential relations (see a concise overview in [Speas 2018]). This is rather similar to how 
Jakobson decomposes statements marked for evidentiality into three distinct “event types”: the 
narrated event, the narrated speech event (i.e. evidence base, or evidence acquisition time), and 
the speech event [Jakobson 1984].
Bergqvist [2018] deﬁ nes evidentials as denoting a relation between an event and a “ground” 
in terms of the directness of access. Following Goffman [1981] and Kockelman’s [2004] analysis 
of Q’eqchi’ modal clitics, he associates each of Jakobson’s event types with a speciﬁ c “speaker 
role”. Speaker roles divide the tasks performed by a speaker in a speech event into three distinct 
roles: the author composes an utterance, the animator utters it, and the “cognizer” has access 
to the information conveyed by the utterance.9 Consequently, the author verbalises the original 
event, the animator is in charge of the speech event, and the cognizer is the reference point for 
the “source event” (i.e. Jakobson’s narrated speech event). When speaker roles align, each role 
is performed by the same person. On the other hand, in case of a direct quote the animator is 
distinct from the author. According to Bergqvist, the degree of overlap between event types due 
to the alignment of speaker roles correlates with the evidentials’ scope properties. For example, 
participatory evidentials (where a speaker’s active participation in an event forms the source 
of their information), align all three roles, and have narrow scope. Reported speech marking cre-
ates more distance between event types, and tends to have wide scope. As a result, evidentials 
can be ordered along a cline as in Figure 1, adapted from Bergqvist [2018: 37].
narrow scope
factual / participatory
visual, sensory
inferential
deduction

wide scope
Figure 1. Cline of evidential values [Bergqvist 2018: 37]
Kockelman’s [2004] analysis showed the opposite result: for modal clitics, more overlap be-
tween event types results in wider scope. Although this is an interesting suggestion, Bergqvist 
does not examine the scope properties of various evidentials beyond a single example where 
a reportative scopes over a visual evidential in Oksapmin [Bergqvist 2018: 34–37].
 
8 A more appropriate term might be simply indexical, see also [Boye 2018: 266] and [Hanks 2014] for 
discussion on the term “deictic” with respect to evidentials.
 
9 Bergqvist’s cognizer corresponds to the role of “principal” in [Goffman 1981] and [Kockelman 2004].

From the perspective of functional discourse grammar, Hengeveld & Hattnher [2015] argue 
that reportatives operate on a different level of grammar, motivated by their “high” scope in com-
parison to other evidentials. According to Hengeveld & Hattnher, reportatives can scope over 
imperatives and hortatives, whereas other evidentials are limited to declarative and interrogative 
illocutions [Ibid.: 487]. They illustrate this with an example where the Hup Reportative Clitic 
mah scopes over an imperative. In her reference grammar of Hup, Epps comments on this ex-
ample that the reportative is used here “as a type of quotative” [Epps 2008: 656], which seems 
like a more reasonable explanation. Note that it is not uncommon for a single marker to cover 
both reportative and quotative functions. In his discussion of evidentials’ scope properties, Boye 
[2010] argues that the wider scope of reportatives in available examples is probably a pragmati-
cally motivated phenomenon, rather than the result of syntactic restrictions:
 
“Situations in which you have direct or inferential evidence for some reportive evidence 
are pragmatically implausible. The idea of witnessing some piece of reportive evidence, 
or arriving at it through inference, is decidedly odd. By contrast, a situation in which some-
one wrote to or told you about some piece of direct or inferential evidence is perfectly con-
ceivable.” [Boye 2010: 303]
For the remaining evidential values besides reportative, Hengeveld & Hattnher [2015: 509] 
provide the following implicational hierarchy.
event perception (direct)  deduction (inferential)  inference (presumptive)
Figure 2. Implicational hierarchy of evidentiality 10
This hierarchy predicts that a language marking presumptive will also have markers for in-
ferential and direct sensory perception. If a language marks only one of these three values, it is 
direct sensory perception. The study is based on a sample of 64 languages of Brazil, which are 
known for their elaborate systems of evidential marking. As a result, the implications predicted 
are not cross-linguistically valid. In other parts of the world (such as the “Evidential Belt” dis-
cussed in Section 2 of this paper), it is rather common to mark inferential (and reportative), but 
not direct sensory perception.
Langacker [2017] analyses evidentiality as a form of clausal grounding within the framework 
of cognitive grammar. He characterises evidentials as indicating increments of distance from 
a deictic centre, and maps evidential values from speciﬁ c languages onto the “cognitive sub-
strates” presumably underlying them. Figure 3 shows the ordering of cognitive substrates and 
their surface realisations in Wanka Quechua.

Most immediate is internal experience, which includes pain, emotion and proprioception 
[Ibid.: 20]. Based on data from English, Hopi, Tariana, Wanka Quechua, Eastern Pomo and Ship-
ibo-Konibo, Langacker predicts that less immediate source types are more likely to be marked, 
which is diametrically opposed to the prediction of Hengeveld & Hattnher discussed above. Evi-
dence from research on acquisition seems to support an ordering of evidentials from direct to in-
direct, with inference occupying the intermediate position between perception and report, since 
this is the order in which source distinctions and their corresponding evidentials are acquired 
 10 My notes between brackets.

(see Section 5). It should be pointed out, however, that currently available research is mostly 
limited to languages with relatively small evidential systems.
Langacker also infers that the relative distance of an information source to the deictic centre 
translates into the deictic centre’s attitude towards certain knowledge: “Evidentials are nonethe-
less organized egocentrically with respect to source and reliability of information” [Langacker 
2017: 30]. Givón [1982: 44] draws a similar conclusion from his four “scalar hierarchies of ev-
idence”, e.g. personal / deictic hierarchy: speaker > hearer > third party and sensory / source hi-
erarchy: vision > hearing > other senses > feeling. This is not borne out in cross-linguistic data. 
Evidentiality and epistemic modality are two distinct conceptual categories [de Haan 1999]. 
They often interact in complicated ways, and it remains unclear how their relationship is best 
described (for example in terms of overlap or inclusion, as discussed in [Wiemer 2018: 87–90]), 
but they do not necessarily co-occur.
An advantage of deictic or deictic-like approaches is that they capture the communicative 
function of evidentials beyond their semantic content. The proposition of an intermediary ref-
erence point in the form of a source event or evidence acquisition time helps to distinguish ev-
identiality from other categories such as tense and epistemic modality, because they designate 
other types of relations. They also exclude quotatives by deﬁ nition, since quotatives designate 
the proposition itself rather than an intermediary event between the proposition and the speech 
event. On the other hand, it allows the inclusion of participatory evidence, because the speak-
er’s participation can be viewed as a source event that runs parallel to a narrated event, similar 
to visual perception. General knowledge is a bit problematic in this regard. It can be described 
only as a non-speciﬁ ed source event. Obviously the speaker obtained this kind of information 
somehow, but they either cannot or will not attribute it to a particular type of source. A prom-
ising aspect of deictic approaches is that they take into account the speech event as a reference 
point that may inﬂ uence the use of evidentials, although so far this component has not been ex-
plored in great detail within these frameworks (see Section 6 on the use of evidentials in inter-
action). Scalar hierarchies and their implications also require further investigation.
5. Evidentiality and cognition
The idea that certain languages oblige speakers to specify how they know something speaks 
to the imagination.
 
“Franz Boas [1942: 182] suggests that ‘we could read our newspapers with much greater 
satisfaction if our language would compel them to say whether their reports are based 
on self-experience, inference or hearsay!’. And in Palmer’s [1996: 200] words, ‘what a lot 
of breath and ink this might save us in English if we had evidential sufﬁ xes that we could 
use in the courtroom.’ ” [Aikhenvald 2018: 1]
However, as pointed out by Fitneva [2018: 186], evidentials are not necessarily used “verad-
ically”. Speakers can employ evidentials to support a lie (see e.g. [König 2013] on !Xun). Their 
information may come from mixed sources, for example when a speaker witnessed an event 
and heard about it from another eyewitness’ perspective, in which case they simply select the 
source they wish to convey. Speakers can also misremember how they know something. The 
use of evidentials in language relies on humans’ cognitive ability to “monitor sources”: to iden-
tify the source for a piece of information [Johnson 1988]. As pointed out by Ünal & Papafragou 
[2018: 175]: “people do not tag their memories with source information”, hence they can make 
mistakes when retrieving how they know something. Test subjects can claim, for example, that 
they saw pictures of an event when actually they read a vivid description of it [Intraub, Hoffman 
1992]. Research on source monitoring among speakers of English and Turkish did not reveal 
a cognitive advantage for speakers of an evidential language (i.e. Turkish) in this regard (see the 
126 
Voprosy Jazykoznanija 
2019. № 6
discussion of various experiments in [Ünal, Papafragou 2018]), although it remains to be ascer-
tained whether this also applies to speakers of languages with more complex evidential systems.
Children seem to develop the ability to ascribe a source to a piece of information prior to their 
acquisition of evidentials [Ibid.]. Visual access is understood ﬁ rst, and consequently, direct evi-
dentiality is acquired ﬁ rst. Interestingly, the acquisition of indirect evidential meanings follows 
a parallel trajectory in Turkish and Quechua [Fitneva 2018: 191]. Turkish features a general in-
direct form, which covers inference and hearsay, while Quechua has distinct morphemes for 
both meanings. Turkish children learn to use the indirect marker as an inferential ﬁ rst, and later 
extend its use to include hearsay. In Quechua, children start using the inferential clitic earlier 
than the hearsay clitic. This path is also mirrored in the grammaticalisation path of general in-
direct markers from resultative or perfect forms of the verb [Bybee et al. 1994: 105]. After the 
form obtains an inferential reading, it can expand its usage to hearsay contexts and generalises 
towards a general indirect marker.
In children’s speech, the use of indirect evidentials in storytelling precedes the use of these 
markers to indicate a hearsay source, speciﬁ cally, which probably results from the role this 
discourse genre plays in child-directed speech (a detailed observational study on this topic is 
[Aksu-Koç 1988]). Estonian children by contrast rarely use the indirect marker -vat. Accord-
ing to [Tamm et al. 2018], this is due to its low frequency overall and in child-directed speech 
in particular. The Estonian indirect marker, which also conveys doubt on the part of the speaker, 
is grammaticalized but not obligatory.11 This is different from the situation in a language like 
Turkish, where the unmarked alternative to the indirect form at least implies that the speaker had 
more direct access. Cross-linguistic comparison of how children acquire evidential expressions 
provides another dimension for the study of what distinguishes forms of varying grammatical 
status expressing the same meaning.
6. Evidentials in discourse
The relationship between evidentials and actual underlying information sources is not straight-
forward. The previous section addressed some complications in this regard on a subjective 
level, such as failure to recall the correct information source and compressing multiple sources 
into one. In the present section, I discuss how the intersubjective level inﬂ uences the choice 
of forms. Evidentials used in interaction are inﬂ uenced by the genre of discourse, and by the 
way in which speakers want to assert themselves based on what they imagine to be the expecta-
tions of the addressee. Joint knowledge markers encode the perspective of the addressee within 
the evidential paradigm. They do not represent a separate evidential value, but add a speciﬁ ca-
tion to a type of information source. Maaka, for example, has a Visual Evidential which refers 
to directly witnessed events. The Joint Visual Evidential refers to things visible to the speaker 
and the addressee [Storch 2018: 624–626]. See also [Evans et al. 2018: 150–158] for examples 
and discussion of evidentials that incorporate the addressee perspective.
Grzech [2016] describes how Discourse Enclitics in Tena Kichwa (which have been described 
as evidentials for other Quechuan varieties) are employed in the marking of epistemic authority 
and the negotiation of the common ground between discourse participants. The clitic ꞊mi, for 
example, marks the speaker’s “epistemic primacy” — they are certain that X is the case. (This 
is not necessarily because they have direct information.) The clitic ꞊tá has the same function, 
but ꞊mi is used speciﬁ cally in cases where the speaker suspects that X is new information for 
the hearer, and they might not accept it. On the other hand, ꞊tá is used with previously known 
or expected information [Ibid.: 413–414]. Though the Discourse Clitics of Tena Kichwa are not 
strictly evidentials in Grzech’s analysis, she concludes that:
 11 The sufﬁ x originates from a partitive participle sufﬁ x.
 
 Samira Verhees

“[…] the choice of whether and how to use an evidential/epistemic marker is rarely made 
solely on the grounds of the speaker’s evidence for, or epistemic evaluation of, the prop-
osition expressed. The speakers’ concerns related to their positive and negative face, their 
position as an authority on the subject, and even their social standing, might also be rele-
vant to ‘evidential/epistemic practice’.” [Grzech 2016: 414]
In a similar vein, Korean reportatives are employed to render information acquired directly 
by the speaker to avoid threatening the positive face of the addressee [Ahn, Yap 2015].
Another way in which the (projected) expectations of speech act participants other than the 
speaker come into play is through cultural pragmatics. Nuckolls [2018] provides a detailed 
discussion of how Evidential Enclitics in Pastaza Quichua are used in interaction. In Pastaza 
Quichua discourse, properly contextualising an utterance in terms of perspective is key, and 
imposing a personal perspective on another participant results in a highly marked construction. 
The clitic mi, which is a cognate of the Tena Kichwa clitic mi discussed above, is used to mark 
“a source of knowledge as based on the perspective of the speaker of a speech event or on the 
perspective of the speaker of a reported speech event” [Ibid.: 202]. In combination with the sec-
ond person, the result is a face-threatening act, as in the example below. (Example (9) is embed-
ded in a narrative, and reﬂ ects the perspective of the person whose speech is quoted.)
(9) 
P������ Q������ [Nuckolls 2018: 209–210]
 
kan-manda-mi   kasna    tuku-nchi    ni-shka
you-from-����1    like.this   become-1��   say-����
‘Because of you we have become like this, she said (accusing him).’
In traditional narratives, the use of evidentials is subject to conventionalisation. The narra-
tive context in this case overrides the information source parameter. Conventions in turn can be 
manipulated. Traditional narratives in Tsez, for example, can be rendered entirely in the Unwit-
nessed Past. The narrator may also commence in the Unwitnessed Past and then switch to the 
Witnessed Past. According to Comrie & Polinsky [2007], the use of the Witnessed Past in an un-
witnessed context “enlivens” the narrative, similar to the use of the Historical Present in English. 
In the Turkic language Salar, direct forms are used to “foreground” information in an otherwise 
indirect narrative [Dwyer 2000: 55–56]. Indirect forms in Turkish and Old Japanese are associ-
ated with ﬁ ctional narratives, while historical accounts are rendered with their unmarked counter-
parts (which may have overtones of direct evidentiality) [Shinzato 1991: 32–33, 38–41], see also 
Friedman [2003] on the manipulation of similar forms in Macedonian and Albanian newspapers.
An interesting perspective comes from Howard’s [2018] analysis of stories about the mytho-
logical creature Achkay in Huamalíes Quechua. Geographical surroundings form an important 
component of these narratives. Howard noticed that speakers who situate the events in known 
surroundings using local toponyms tend to use past tenses associated with personal experience, 
as opposed to the reported past used as default narrative tense by other speakers. The choice 
of evidentials in this case correlates with the spatial framing of the story, rather than the infor-
mation source of the speaker in a strict sense.
Evidentials’ dependency on context naturally has consequences for methodology and ﬁ eld 
work. Sentence-by-sentence elicitation with questionnaires, where speakers are given a context 
and a sentence to translate from a lingua franca, requires a high degree of concentration and im-
mersion in the situation intended by the researcher. The speaker has to imagine a speech event 
where they tell someone about another event, about which they acquired information in a third, 
implicit event. The unnatural setting of such elicitation can prompt speakers to simply omit ev-
identials, and to render literal and dry translations that are far removed from their behaviour 
in spontaneous discourse (see [Aikhenvald 2004: 18]). Of course this is not necessarily the case. 
A speaker may very well be rather good at imagining the intended context and produce a natural 
utterance. Nonetheless, immersion (or lack thereof) on the side of the speaker as a variable in pos-
sible outcomes of an elicitation task is difﬁ cult to measure or verify. According to Aikhenvald, 
128 
Voprosy Jazykoznanija 
2019. № 6
elicitation should be used only to corroborate ideas about evidentials, whereas the basis of knowl-
edge about evidentiality should always be natural language use in a diverse range of situations 
[Ibid.: 358]. Elicitation can be used as an auxiliary method to determine cases where evidentials 
cannot be used, and with which elements they cannot co-occur. Brosig [2018] complemented 
his analysis of ten hours of natural discourse in Khalkha Mongolian with consultations with na-
tive speakers, in which he asked them to interpret the examples, and judge whether another form 
could be used in the same context.
Corpora can be problematic in their own way. A corpus ideally contains copious amounts 
of material covering any discourse setting imaginable. For many languages with grammati-
cal evidentiality, however, large and heterogenous corpora are not available, because the lan-
guages have no written tradition or writing system and are limited to small(er) communities. 
As a result, corpora consist of material recorded by ﬁ eld researchers, opening the possibility 
of an observer’s paradox. As pointed out by Kittilä et al. [2018: 292–294], the mere presence 
of the researcher during the recording process may inﬂ uence the use of evidentials. Aside from 
the fact that ﬁ eld corpora in the best case are still relatively small and sample a limited num-
ber of speakers, certain evidentials are rare even in large and diverse sets of data. Alternatively, 
the researcher can generate natural speech with experimental tasks, such as the Family Prob-
lems Picture Task by San Roque et al. [2012], in which speakers have to construct a story based 
on picture cards. Speakers work together in groups and discuss the contents of the cards and 
how they should be arranged. These cards are designed especially to elicit emotional reactions 
and stimulate the use of knowledge categories. Examples of evidential-like utterances elicited 
using this method are in Gipper’s [2018] study of the Uncertain Perceptual / Inferential marker 
shi in Yurakaré. Silva & AnderBois [2016] used the game Mastermind to elicit evidentials in De-
sano, and Mushin [2001] asked speakers of Macedonian, Japanese and English to retell stories 
from a corpus of personal experience narratives. An advantage of such approaches is that they 
result in moderately controlled data with a relatively high density of evidential forms and mark-
ers of other knowledge categories.
7. Conclusion
In this paper I discussed how evidentiality is deﬁ ned in contemporary linguistic research. 
In recent years evidentiality has become established as a distinct grammatical category. At the 
same time, a lot of research was done on non-grammatical evidentiality (including lexical as well 
as not quite grammaticalised expressions). A persistent issue in the study of evidentiality is not 
whether we should consider it a grammatical or a semantic-functional category, but rather how 
we can make a meaningful, empirical distinction between grammatical evidentials and other 
means of referring to an information source. As I showed in Section 2, general indirect forms, 
which are characteristic of languages spoken in Eurasia, are assumed to be evidentials, while 
this interpretation is at odds with language-speciﬁ c accounts. As an example, Turkic Indirec-
tives in Johanson’s [2018] analysis do not meet Aikhenvald’s criterion for separating eviden-
tials from evidential strategies, because information source marking is arguably not their main 
function. At the same time, Turkish features in a large number of studies as an uncontroversial 
example of a language with grammatical evidentiality. More straightforward empirical criteria 
for the distinction of various types of evidential and evidential-like expressions are a necessary 
precursory to comparative research on evidentiality, which is currently lacking.
In Section 3, I discussed the speciﬁ c values attributed to evidentiality’s semantic domain. Al-
though egophoricity can occur as an independent category, participatory / egophoric evidence 
deserves a place in the domain. It represents a natural distinction within the direct subdomain. 
For reported speech markers, Aikhenvald proposes an important distinction of reportatives and 
quotatives. The latter differ in several aspects from other evidentials. Most importantly, their

function is to mark a quotation (not an information source), which may or may not implicate 
an actual reported speech event. Among reportatives, second-hand may be distinct from third-
hand. General knowledge is marked with a dedicated morpheme at least in one language, licens-
ing its inclusion as a separate value in the domain. As a side note, linear visualisations as pre-
sented in Section 3 of this paper are perhaps not the best tool for charting semantic ﬁ elds in typol-
ogy, since they cannot convey the ﬂ exibility of certain values (e.g. inferential or general knowl-
edge, which may pair with various other meanings depending on the language).
From a variety of theoretical frameworks, evidentials are construed as deictic or indexical 
elements designating a relation between a narrated event and a speech event from the perspec-
tive of a deictic centre. These approaches are fruitful b ecause they can characterise the func-
tions of evidentials in discourse besides their semantic content (see Section 4). This is import-
ant, because evidentials are highly context-sensitive, as discussed in Section 6. Several authors 
propose intuitively plausible clines where information sources are ranked by their proximity 
to the deictic centre (e.g. direct — inference — report). It remains to be ascertained to what ex-
tent their predictions for various evidentials’ scope properties and their likelihood to be marked 
in a given language are supported by cross-linguistic data.
It also remains unclear to what extent accounts of how various information sources are “or-
dered” based on linguistic data map onto cognition. It is tempting to project all sorts of intuitions 
onto evidential data, for example about the speaker’s attitude toward speciﬁ c types of informa-
tion source, their motivation to choose a certain form, as well as ideas of increased source mem-
ory or responsibility for specifying source among speakers of evidential languages, but these 
presumptions can obscure actual language facts, and should be used with caution.
