Strategies in Performing a Multi-Level C-Test:  
Applying Think-Aloud Protocols 
 
The aims of this study were: 1) to identify the cognitive strategies that Russian EFL 
learners apply while taking a multi-level C-test; 2) to examine the correlation between the 
level of complexity of a C-test and the frequency of the usage of the cognitive strategies. The 
Think-Aloud Protocols method allowed to reveal seven cognitive strategies (predicting, 
summarizing, questioning, making connections, re-reading/using fix-ups, identifying a 
problem, and reflecting). The results of chi-square tests indicate that texts with different 
complexity levels can trigger different type of processing used by the test-takers. 
Keywords: c-Test; cognitive strategies; language proficiency assessment; think-aloud 
protocols 
 
Introduction 
 
C-tests are gap-filling tests that consist of several short texts in which parts 
of words are missing. They are widely used to assess general language profi-
ciency for purposes of placement, screening, or provision of feedback to lan-
guage learners. Various studies have revealed that C-tests are integrative and 
highly reliable and valid measures of general language proficiency [1–3]. This 
study is motivated by the work of Babaii and Moghaddam [4], with the underly-
ing assumption that the C-test at different proficiency levels triggers the use of 
different test-taking strategies on the part of learners. We seek to investigate 
how the shift in the text difficulty level of the C-test input (proficient, intermedi-
ate, and beginner) influences the strategies employed by test-takers. We at-
tempted to answer this question through applying an introspective think-aloud 
protocol (TAP) method. 
 
Literature Review 
 
The C-test was designed as an instance of reduced redundancy testing and 
was claimed to be more representative in terms of assessing language proficien-
cy than multiple cloze-tests or cloze-elide tests [3]. A typical C-test consists of 
four or five short texts where the second half of every second word is deleted 
6                      Esmat Babaii, Tatiana M. Permyakova, Ekaterina V. Pozdeeva 
 
(the rule of two). The gaps have to be filled in by second/foreign language test-
takers. Each passage has approximately 20 gaps. The first introductory sentence 
is left intact while the rule of two applies to the rest of the passage. 
The C-test is believed and confirmed to be a well-established measure for L2 
proficiency level, in different language contexts, for example, Estonia [5, 6], 
Germany [7], Hungary [2], Thailand [8], Iran [9], and China [10]. To the best of 
our knowledge, the only published research recruiting a Russian-speaking sam-
ple is the one conducted by Drackert and Timukova [11] where the C-test was 
found to be biased towards heritage language learners and therefore was not 
deemed satisfactorily valid. 
The C-test is a highly reliable and valid instrument [7], as it also correlates 
well with other proficiency tests such as MTELP – Michigan Test of English Lan-
guage Proficiency [12], MCT – a multiple-choice achievement test, TOEFL – Test 
of English as a Foreign Language [9], or a Cloze test [3]. The most notable con-
tradictory result, perhaps, is reported by Jafarpur [13] who investigated the varie-
ties of the C-test by applying different deletion procedures. The results of the 
study revealed that different versions of the C-tests did not bear similar character-
istics, and findings refuted the claims on C-testing as an adequate measure of gen-
eral language proficiency. Hastings [14], in response, provided a detailed analysis 
of Jafarpur’s methodology vis-a-vis the principal rules of the C-test and concluded 
that his controversial findings were due to flouting the rules. 
Furthermore, when it comes to the support of applicability of the C-test to 
various specific contexts, the results are mixed. Dörnyei and Katona [2] believe 
that the C-test is applicable to different proficiency levels. Muller and Daller 
[15] used C-test with correlation to IELTS (r = 0.509, p < .001) to measure 
whether these tests are appropriate for the medical professional context. Similar-
ly, Prediger et al. [16] found that language proficiency is the background factor 
with the strongest connection to mathematics achievement among all social and 
linguistic background factors. The study by Daller and colleagues [17] corrobo-
rates the validity of the C-test in examining the fluency and overall oral profi-
ciency among bilingual speakers, with correlations ranging from .31 to .63 for 
different determiners of proficiency. On the other hand, Mashad’s study [12] 
claims that the C-test does not prove to behave consistently with examinees of 
different proficiency levels; in particular, it cannot differentiate participants of 
lower and upper intermediate levels. To solve the problem, modifications to C-
tests were made to increase and decrease the difficulty of the test by manipulat-
ing the size and the distribution of gaps in order to be able to generate C-tests 
with the desired difficulty levels [18]. These findings were consistent with the 
reliability of test scores in a modified C-test procedure [19]. 
Despite the abundance of research on the C-test and its psychometric charac-
teristics, there is a scarcity of research regarding possible interactions between 
text characteristics and the nature of processing in the C-test completion. One of 
the works that attempts to investigate whether difficult test tasks can trigger 
more macro-level processing in C-testing is by Babaii and Moghaddam [4]. 
Their research involved manipulating degrees of syntactic complexity and ab-

straction as text variables and presenting the chosen texts in two formats: with or 
without clues regarding the number of missing letters. Out of the sample of 119 
students, 36 participated in the retrospective think-aloud phase of the study. The 
think-aloud protocol analysis revealed that employing texts with more syntactic 
complexity and abstraction, along with eliminating clues with respect to the num-
ber of missing letters can result in more difficult test tasks which seemed to en-
courage a more frequent use of macro-level processing on the part of test takers. 
Several studies focus on the interplay between text difficulty, learners’ lan-
guage proficiency level and the type and frequency of (meta)cognitive strategies 
learners use for processing and understanding. Kaivanpanah and Moghaddam 
[20] investigated how different levels of L2 reading proficiency may affect the 
readers’ inferencing behavior with respect to the level of success they achieve as 
well as the types, combinations, and frequencies of knowledge sources they use 
when inferring meanings of unknown words. They found that differences in 
L2 reading proficiency level had a profound impact on inferencing success. 
However, the contribution of the knowledge sources used by the participants 
was found to be partial and restricted. Their findings partially confirmed the re-
sults of previous studies [21] on the contribution of topic familiarity and text 
difficulty on the test takers’ performance in reading comprehension tests in lan-
guage for specific purposes. 
Similarly, Zhang [22] contends that EFL proficiency is linked with language 
learners’ metacognitive knowledge or awareness of strategies. Using TAP, 
Zhang [23] employed a 28-item survey of reading strategies to explore relation-
ship between metacognitive awareness and reading-strategy use of Chinese high 
school students. The strategies were classified into three categories: global, 
problem-solving, and support. The high-proficiency group outperformed the 
intermediate group and the low-proficiency group in two categories of reading 
strategies: global and problem-solving; but no statistically significant difference 
was found among the three proficiency groups in using support strategies. 
A number of introspective studies examined the effect of EFL learners’ read-
ing proficiency on the nature of lexical inferencing they employed while reading 
in English. Learners were found to use the knowledge sources and contextual 
cues differently; and the level of success and their rate of learning and retention 
of the inferred target words varied [24]. Reading proficiency in L1 is a contrib-
uting factor to general proficiency measured by C-testing and other text-
dependent tests [25]. Yet, it seems that learners need to establish some 
knowledge of an L2 per se before they can successfully draw on their L1 reading 
ability to help with L2 reading in certain tasks like C-test completion. 
An intriguing contribution to this line of research was done by Soemer and 
Schiefele [26] dealing with the question of how the difficulty of a text could 
affect a reader’s thinking including but not limited to task-unrelated thinking 
(mind wandering) during reading. In the study, participants read three texts rated 
as easy, moderate, or difficult in terms of readability and cohesion. During read-
ing, participants were required to indicate whether they were engaging in mind 
wandering. The results showed that reading difficult texts increased mind wan-
8                      Esmat Babaii, Tatiana M. Permyakova, Ekaterina V. Pozdeeva 
 
dering and this increase partially explained the negative relation between text 
difficulty and comprehension. 
Among introspective techniques used to detect L2 learners’ mental processes, 
Think-Aloud Protocol (TAP) method is a feasible procedure alleviating the need 
for utilizing highly sophisticated equipment to explore the cognitive processes 
which are not directly observable [27]. So far, there are few works on the accounts 
of test-takers’ mental processes in the C-test [28]. Babaii and Ansary [9] as well as 
Babaii and Moghaddam [4] employed TAP to explore the nature of processing in 
the C-test where both micro- and macro-level processing emerged after the analy-
sis of test-takers’ TAPs. In another study, Babaii and Fatahi-Majd [29] investigat-
ed the test-takers’ failed attempts to complete the blanks through retrospective 
verbal protocols. High and low performers were reported to experience diverse 
psycholinguistic obstacles and mechanisms. While the high performers struggled 
with retrieving the appropriate lexical items and overlooked delicate points of 
grammar, the low performers suffered most from breakdown in text processing 
and automatic restoration based on the local clues. 
To summarize, the study of available literature on the C-test points to the pau-
city of research on the modifications of this test in terms of difficulty levels. Spe-
cifically, literature overview shows a gap in the introspective use of TAP with 
regard to strategies employed while C-testing. We assume that the C-test at differ-
ent proficiency levels may trigger the use of different reading strategies on the part 
of test-takers. The research gains momentum considering the fact that Russian 
EFL learners remain an under-investigated sample in this area of inquiry. 
 
Method 
 
Participants and settings 
A total number of 20 participants took part in this study. To ensure the sam-
ple’s homogeneity, they were all selected from Higher School of Economics, 
aged from 20 to 22, with the average age being 21.3, both males (50%) and fe-
males (50%). The participants were Russian native speakers with the recognized 
upper-intermediate level in terms of the English language proficiency. To ensure 
they all have the same level of reading proficiency, the participants were pre-
tested and had to undergo an EF Standard English Test (https://www.efset.org/ 
english-certificate). This test provides the analysis of the test taker’s reading 
skills, and its results are aligned with CEFR levels. 
This study applied a qualitative method using the Think-Aloud Protocol. The 
participants were asked to complete the missing parts in the passages and verbal-
ize as much as possible anything that went through their minds while they were 
doing the task. 
Materials 
To ensure the reliability and validity of the material, the passages presented 
to the participants were extracted from Reading and Use of English sections of 
the test papers provided by Cambridge Assessment English (Appendix 1). The 
C-test contained three passages, with the first one extracted from B1 Prelimi-
Strategies in Performing a Multi-Level C-test                                    9 
 
 
nary, the second one from B2 First, and the third one from C2 Proficiency tests. 
The texts’ lexical complexity increased from B1 to C2, with the latter containing 
more long words (6 letters and more, 3 syllables and more) and fewer frequent 
words. The syntactic complexity also grew from B1 to C2 text, with the latter 
having more participial constructions and nominal phrases. Each passage con-
tained 24 to 25 gaps and was chosen in such a way that the content did not cor-
relate with the test takers’ professional areas to eliminate the possibility of some 
participants having an advantage over others. The reliability index calculated 
through KR-21 for the C-test was 0.78. This seems a satisfactory index of con-
sistency considering the homogeneity of test-takers in terms of language profi-
ciency level which generally leads to under-estimation of reliability [30]. 
Procedure 
Data collection started in September 2018 and lasted for 2 months. The C-tests 
were presented to each participant individually on paper task sheets, and the as-
signed time for completing three passages was 30 minutes. The researchers asked 
the participants to verbalize whatever came to their minds while they were filling in 
the gaps in each passage. The researchers recorded the participants’ verbalized 
thoughts providing prompts when they forgot to “think aloud” by asking questions 
such as “Why do you use this particular word to fill in the missing part?” The re-
cordings were later transcribed into protocols that were used to analyze the data and 
spell out the strategies which the participants chose to perform the task.  
As the test takers verbalized their thoughts, they typically used sentences 
such as “I think this should be <…. because …>.”, “I will re-read the first sen-
tence”, “I do not know exactly what it is going to be but I think …”, etc. As 
Baumann and colleagues [31] stated, such sentences can serve as indicators of 
the following strategies: Predicting, Clarifying, Questioning, Making Connec-
tions, Re-Reading/Using Fix-Ups, Summarizing, and Commenting. Derived 
from reading comprehension techniques, strategies were identified by verbalized 
items, usually preceding the blank to be filled. The researchers analyzed the pro-
tocols to recognize what strategies the participants used to complete the C-tests. 
 
Analysis of Data and Results 
 
The participants’ think-aloud protocols were studied to find out what cogni-
tive strategies were used when the participants filled the gaps in the C-tests. The 
data were converted to several types of cognitive strategies: Predicting, Summa-
rizing, Questioning, Making Connections, Re-Reading/Using Fix-Ups, Identify-
ing a Problem, and Reflecting. 
The Predicting strategy involved making use of clues while doing the test. 
For instance, while filling in the gap in “t_____ discuss rese______ into”, one of 
the participants stated, “to discuss… research. I think it’s research here because 
discuss goes with a noun”. 
Another strategy which was used by the test takers was Summarizing. The 
participants applied it when they put some information from the passage into 
their own words. In case of “hoping t____ get ri_____”, one of the participants 
10                      Esmat Babaii, Tatiana M. Permyakova, Ekaterina V. Pozdeeva 
 
said, “the passage is about discovering gold in Alaska, so I guess people came 
there hoping to get rich. Yes, it’s rich here”. 
The Questioning strategy means that the subjects asked themselves questions 
when they faced difficulty trying to find the answer. For instance, faced with 
“plen___ of dir____ daily exper_____”, a participant said, “plenty of some experi-
ence… dir…. daily experience….What experience could they have?” 
Making Connections was a frequently applied strategy when the participants 
tried to make a connection between what they were reading and what they have al-
ready read, or their background knowledge about the world. Faced with “no sin____ 
governing bo___”, one of the test takers said, “I think I have heard the phrase gov-
erning body. It can be a governing body here. No single governing body”. 
The Re-Reading/Using Fix-Ups strategy, as the name itself suggests, in-
volves re-reading the text and the intact co-text. Dealing with “such st_____ 
training”, the test taker said, “st… training… I should re-read the whole text 
again to understand”. 
Another strategy, Identifying a Problem, was used when the participants had 
to deal with those gaps that they did not know how to fill. They usually verbal-
ized this strategy saying “I am not sure”, “I do not know what to fill it with” or 
any other phrase indicating they have faced a cognitive challenge. For instance, 
having to deal with “and enfor________ of” one of the subjects said, “It is diffi-
cult. I am sure it is about laws but I can’t think of any word”. 
Reflecting as a cognitive strategy was applied when the participants “turned 
back” to explain or interpret their gap-filling decisions. For instance, in case of 
“to outs____ humans”, the test taker said, “Initially, I thought it could be out-
stand but then replaced it with outsmart because the text said that rats were clev-
er and intelligent”. 
During the procedure, strategies were identified by verbalized items, which 
usually preceded the blank to be filled. Some of the filled blanks were not com-
mented upon by the respondents. When the two strategies could have been in-
terpreted as overlapping, for instance, Re-Reading and Reflecting, the research-
ers turned to verbal protocols for the supporting markers such as phrases “I need 
to re-read” or “I think … because …” to distinguish between the two. 
The analysis revealed that the participants used seven strategies while per-
forming the gap-filling task. However, the usages of the strategies differed: 
while some of them were applied intensively, the others were used less frequent-
ly. Moreover, the frequency of occurrence of these strategies varied in corre-
spondence to the level of the difficulty of the passages (B1, B2, C2). Table 1 
presents the data on how often strategies were applied in each passage; figures 
in bold are 5% above the average and figures in cursive are 5% below the aver-
age in each column. 
When the participants had to deal with the passage of the B2 level, which 
was pre-tested as their baseline, Making Connections was the most frequently 
used strategy (26%). In case of the B1 passage, the participants applied it slight-
ly less often (22%); however, when they did the C2 level test, only 10% of the 
gaps in the text were filled using this strategy.

Predicting was close to Making Connections at the B2 level – the test takers 
applied it to fill in 21% of the gaps. In case of the B1 and C2 texts, the use of 
this strategy followed the same pattern as Making Connections did – the fre-
quency of occurrence decreased to 13% and 10% respectively.  
At the B2 level, Reflecting was used to fill in 21% of the gaps. However, when 
the test takers had to fill in the gaps in the B1 passage, they “reflected” on their 
performance much less intensively – only in 5% out of the total number of gaps. 
In case of the C2 text, the frequency of occurrence decreased to reach 15%. 
The rest of the strategies were used less frequent at the B2 level. Re-
Reading/Using Fix-Ups” was used to fill 7% of the gaps. When the participants 
took the B1 and C2 tests, they applied it more often – 19% and 15% respectively. 
The sixth applied strategy at the B2 level was Identifying a Problem, which 
was used to fill in 10% of the gaps. At the B1 level, its frequency of occurrence 
did not change much – the participants stated they had to deal with a problem in 
9% out of the total number of tasks. However, when they had to do the C2 text, 
they applied it to 22% of the gaps. 
Questioning was the least frequently used strategy in case of the B2 and B1 
tests (7% and 5%), while in case of the C2 test the frequency of occurrence grew 
to reach 15%. 
The data indicated that Summarizing and Reflecting were the strategies 
showing the highest deviation from the average at the B1 level – sharply going 
up for Summarizing and sharply going down for Reflecting. At the B2 level the 
trend was reverse – a sharp decrease in using Summarizing and a significant 
increase in using Reflecting. At the C2 level, the strategies that yielded the 
greatest deviation from the average were Making Connections (10% in contrast 
to the average of 19.3%) and Identifying a Problem (22% as opposed to the av-
erage of 13.6%). 
For example, reading a C2 passage, in the Identifying a Problem strategy, a 
test taker often commented on not knowing the word: “There is no // govern-
12                      Esmat Babaii, Tatiana M. Permyakova, Ekaterina V. Pozdeeva 
 
ment / there is no government of what? / Legislature / what is this word? // is-
sues and informs, enforces issues and enforces laws to which any nations / what 
is this word? / there is no / there is no / why do I want to say ‘there is no worry’? 
it does not fit here / I do not know / government of legislature issues and enforc-
es laws to which any / what is the word? I do not know its meaning / the interna-
tional legal order has no sinful / it is either sin or sinful or something else”. 
While dealing with lower level passages, the frequency of the Identifying a 
Problem strategy decreases since correct responses are ensured by automatic 
processing of high frequency lexicon (e.g. “there is no worry”). 
These processes are parallel to the Making Connections strategy. For in-
stance, a participant said: “issues and enforces laws to which // to which gov-
ernment / it must be here because I heard it before / issues and enforces laws // 
There is no // government of legislature issues and enforces laws to which any // 
to which any nations and subjects / it does not connect well // the international 
league order has no / has no // I want to say ‘sinful governing’, but it does not 
meaningfully connect // Governing and operates by agreement between states”. 
Overall, the main reason for the shift in the use of strategies while reading C2 
passages is inability to rely on automatic processing of familiar linguistic items 
and respondents’ acknowledgment of this fact. 
In order to check whether the differences in the use of strategies are statisti-
cally significant, three sets of chi-square tests were applied to the data. As it is 
reported in Table 2, all three comparisons are significant at p < .000 with a 
strong effect size calculated through Cramer’s V [cf. 32].

The findings indicate that texts with different complexity levels can trigger 
different type of processing used by the test-takers. 
 
Discussion and Conclusion 
 
The aim of this study was to investigate the use of cognitive strategies of the 
test takers performing a task that required making decisions and solving prob-
lems. We assumed that the frequency of occurrence of the strategies involved in 
completing a C-test could vary depending on the text difficulty (in terms of the 
English language proficiency levels).  
The results of the study revealed that each test taker applied a set of cognitive 
strategies, with some of them being used more intensively. The extent to which 
each strategy was used reflects the way each participant thinks and solves cogni-
tive problems.

Another finding was that the frequency of the use of each strategy changed 
depending on the passage that the participant had to deal with. As each partici-
pant had the recognized upper-intermediate level (B2) of English, the first pas-
sage (B1) was quite likely to cause less trouble for them while the third passage 
(C2) was expected to be more linguistically challenging. We assumed that the 
differences in the language difficulty of the three passages would influence the 
extent to which the strategies would be applied. The results showed that the fre-
quency of reverse occurrence of the strategies Summarizing and Reflecting dis-
tinguish between reading texts at B1 and B2 levels. C2 text reading is character-
ized by the increase of Questioning and Identifying a Problem strategies. 
From the theoretical perspective, the findings might be useful in assisting to 
arrive at a more unified theory for test-taking strategies [33] since this study 
provided information about the way a group of Russian learners dealt with dif-
ferent difficulty levels in a text-dependent test. A meta-analysis on the contribu-
tion of L1 to the C-test completion could benefit from our study, which recruited 
a Russian sample in a TAP study of the C-test for the first time.  
In line with Mashad’s study [12], the results of this research add to the complica-
tions of tackling C-test difficulty and its interaction with test-taking strategies as the 
observed strategies do not clearly discriminate between different difficulty levels. 
One possible explanation for this is the different degree of involvement in extensive 
reading beyond the classroom for some of the participants [34]. It may also suggest 
that further control for the test-takers’ characteristics such as individual differences, 
core demographics (males and females, age, educational background) and problem-
solving traits is needed [35–38]. Nevertheless, at this point, the use and shift of strat-
egies while performing a multi-level C-test confirm the main findings by Babaii and 
Moghaddam [4], i.e., text characteristics at different levels have potential effects on 
the C-test performing strategies. 
We acknowledge unavoidable restrictions such as a limited sample that did 
not allow conducting standard validity tests. However, given the qualitative ap-
proach adopted, this was not the primary purpose of the study. 
Further studies of TAP in regard to the C-test may also explore the link be-
tween the failure frequency with the text difficulty level, to compare the current 
finding with Salehi and Sanjareh [39], and Babaii and Fatahi-Majd [29]. In addi-
tion, academic version versus general version of international English as a Sec-
ond/Foreign Language could be explored to help administer test-preparation and 
test-taking. This may also involve both topic types and test patterns. 
Ultimately, following the results, pedagogical recommendations could be de-
veloped to build individual trajectories for reading test-taking and/or learning 
vocabulary. Teaching implications of this study also include considering text 
selection for assessment [4] and/or preparing redundancy tests for assessment at 
different proficiency levels [40]. It is the introspective data of the reading ability 
of participants that give teachers the exact estimation of candidates’ abilities to 
identify the source of problem and use interdependent strategies in performance. 
The findings might be of interest for assessors as well.

Использование методики Think-Aloud Protocols для выявления стратегий 
выполнения многоуровневого С-теста

В данном исследовании рассматривается процесс выполнения многоуровневого          
С-теста на английском языке. С-тест представляет собой набор коротких текстов, в 
которых отсутствует часть каждого второго слова. Учащимся необходимо заполнить 
пропуски, т.е. восстановить тексты до исходного состояния. С-тесты широко исполь-
зуются как надежный инструмент для измерения уровня владения иностранным язы-
ком. 
При проведении исследования авторы ставили перед собой две цели: 1) определить 
когнитивные стратегии, которыми пользуются испытуемые-носители русского языка 
при выполнении многоуровневого С-теста на английском языке; 2) выявить соотноше-
ние между частотой использования когнитивных стратегий и уровнем сложности           
С-теста. В эксперименте приняли участие 20 испытуемых, уровень языковой компетен-
ции каждого из которых был определен как В2 (согласно шкале общеевропейских ком-
петенций владения иностранным языком). Испытуемые выполняли С-тест, состоящий 
из трех частей, при этом уровень сложности каждой последующей части возрастал от 
В1 до С2. Для того чтобы определить, какими когнитивными стратегиями испытуемые 
пользовались при выполнении теста, авторы использовали методику Think-Aloud Proto-
cols или метод «думай вслух». 
В результате исследования были выявлены семь когнитивных стратегий, применя-
емых при выполнении С-теста: «прогнозирование», «использование умозаключений», 
«стратегия вопроса», «сопоставление / установление связей», «перечитывание / исполь-
зование подсказок», «выявление проблемы» и «рефлексия». Было установлено, что 
частота использования различных стратегий меняется в зависимости от уровня сложно-
сти текста. Так, например, при выполнении теста уровня В1 наиболее часто применяе-
мыми стратегиями были «использование умозаключений» и «перечитывание / исполь-
зование подсказок», в то время как при выполнении теста уровня В2 возрастала частота 
использования таких стратегий, как «прогнозирование», «сопоставление / установление 
связей» и «рефлексия». При выполнении теста уровня С2 наиболее активно используе-
мыми стратегиями были «стратегия вопроса» и «выявление проблемы». Проверка с 
помощью критерия хи-квадрата позволила сделать вывод, что различия в частоте ис-
пользования когнитивных стратегий являются статистически значимыми и уровень 
сложности текста может инициировать использование различных подходов к выполне-
нию С-теста. 
Полученные результаты могут оказаться полезными для дальнейших исследований 
стратегий, применяемых при выполнении тестов, в частности для исследований, прово-
димых с участием испытуемых-носителей разных языков. Кроме того, полученные 
результаты могут быть использованы для разработки подходов к изучению иноязычной 
лексики, обучению чтению и выполнению тестов на иностранном языке, как общего 
характера, так и с учетом индивидуальных особенностей учащихся.
