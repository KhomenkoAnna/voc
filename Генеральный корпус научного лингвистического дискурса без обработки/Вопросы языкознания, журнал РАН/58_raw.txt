The 35 chapters of this volume, to which 53 scholars (including the three editors) contributed 
their expertise, in conjunction with the extensive bibliography (covering fully 100 pages), offer 
outstanding coverage of the problems presented by ergative alignment, in synchronic morphosyn-
tax (across an impressive range of languages from all of the world’s populated continents), in dia-
chrony, and also in acquisition and sentence processing. The last section of the volume (Part IV) 
contains sixteen chapters presenting a treasure trove of case studies of individual languages or lan-
guage families, written by seasoned experts; 1 but the thirty chapters that precede Part IV also fea-
ture a wealth of data from a smorgasbord of languages with ergative traits. Reading the whole vol-
ume cover to cover is a tour de force that probably very few users of the handbook (apart from its 
reviewers) will subject themselves to, and which is not in every way entirely satisfying (for reasons 
mentioned towards the end of this review). But for all linguists and other interested parties who 
want or need to familiarise themselves with or remind themselves of the hallmarks, explananda, 
explanations, open questions, and controversies associated with ergativity, this volume will from 
now on be their ﬁrst port of call. The handbook is doing linguistics a tremendous service — and it 
also shows how far linguistics has come as a ﬁeld, in its analytical depth and sophistication as well 
as the precision of the debates about matters on which consensus remains elusive.
One thing that emerges perhaps most saliently from a perusal of the handbook is that it is 
highly unlikely that ergativity is a parameter that distinguishes between languages. It is a rare 
thing indeed for a �������� to have consistent ergative alignment in every aspect of its mor-
phosyntax and information structure. Ergativity manifests itself in the case system (with the 
subject of transitive clauses getting a different case, the ‘ergative’, from the subject of intran-
sitive clauses and the object of transitive clauses), in the agreement system (the head-marking 
counterpart to dependent marking in terms of case), in the syntax (accessibility hierarchy ef-
fects in the realm of Ā-dependencies; control; perhaps even word order), and in discourse — but 
rarely if ever in ��� these ways in one and the same language. Therefore, the locution ‘ergative 
language’ is probably best avoided in linguistic parlance.2 Yet, stating (as Léa Nash does in the 
opening paragraphs of her chapter 8, which presents a study of split ergativity in Georgian) that 
‘ergative languages are never fully ergative’ (p. 175) may be too categorical — for instance, Laz 
(Kartvelian) is featured in the handbook as a language that is fully ergative (see p. 7 of the in-
troduction, and section 9.6.3.2 of Woolford’s chapter).
 
1 A very laudable ingredient of Part IV is the chapter (written by Christa König) on ergativity in the lan-
guages of Africa — a continent that does not usually ﬁgure prominently (if at all) in the context of er-
gativity studies. (In truth, this is not without reason: König herself identiﬁes only one ‘full-ﬂedged er-
gative language’ on the continent (Shilluk), and mentions a handful of split-ergative languages.)
 
2 Geoffrey Haig’s chapter (p. 468) quotes Bickel [2011: 442] saying that ‘once popular expressions like 
“ergative language” are simply senseless’.

Be that as it may, the discussion of ergativity splits at many points throughout the handbook 
certainly indicates that there are lots of split personalities in the ergative universe. Ellen Wool-
ford’s chapter gives a very handy overview of the range of deﬁnitions given for ‘split ergativity’ 
in the literature (pp. 206–207), and answers the question of ‘whether the various types of er-
gative splits are present in syntax or are purely morphological’ by saying that ‘with the nota-
ble exception of person / animacy / NP splits’, most ergative splits are syntactic (p. 224).3 This 
dampens the prospects of the ‘TotalErg’ hypothesis (advanced in Itziar Laka’s chapter), which 
has it that ergativity does not split. It may very well be, however, that split ergativity is epi-
phenomenal, derivable from syntactic factors that are not just the privilege of ergative systems, 
as Jessica Coon and Omer Preminger argue in their chapter. Differential case marking is the key 
phrase here: so-called split ergativity is just a different name for ‘differential subject marking’, 
the companion to the ‘differential object marking’ patterns familiar from many languages that 
do not have ergative alignment patterns. Andrej Malchukov conﬁrms in his chapter that the dif-
ferential case-marking patterns exhibited by languages show a correlation with the role-indexing 
pattern that sets ergative–absolutive and nominative–accusative systems apart. But differential 
subject marking is not impossible in languages that usually mark all subjects (of ﬁnite clauses) 
as nominative, nor is differential object marking absent from languages with ergative align-
ment: the passive and antipassive diathesis alternations, respectively, instantiate these patterns.
While passive and antipassive give each alignment system (nominative–accusative and erga-
tive–absolutive) the differential marking pattern which is more typical of the other system, what 
makes the differential marking differential even more complicated is the fact that these voice 
alternations are both found across alignment types: as Maria Polinsky points out in her chapter 
on antipassive (see pp. 328–329), there are ergative systems with a passive; and there may be 
a basis for thinking that the antipassive is compatible with nominative–accusative alignment. 
I used more caution in my formulation of the second conjunct of the previous sentence than in the 
ﬁrst, because I remain less than convinced, at least for the more familiar languages that Polinsky 
includes in her list (German, Romance, Slavic), that the case for them having a genuine anti-
passive is airtight. For instance, Postal’s [1977] argument for antipassivisation in French, based 
on unspeciﬁed object deletion in ‘faire-inﬁnitive’ causative constructions, is far from conclu-
sive: much depends on one’s outlook on the syntax of the case pattern of the Romance causative.
Now that the Romance causative construction has entered the discussion, this may be a good 
moment to draw attention to the occurrence of ‘ergative’ case patterns in otherwise nomina-
tive–accusative languages. The fact that in the French equivalent of I will make him eat his soup 
we see oblique (here, dative) case on the causee (Je lui ferai manger sa soupe ‘I him.��� will.
make eat his soup’) whereas in faire-causatives with an intransitive inﬁnitive (whether it be un-
ergative or unaccusative) the full-nominal causee bears accusative case (Je le ferai rire / tomber 
‘I him.��� will.make laugh / fall’) is a differential case-marking pattern very much like what we 
ﬁnd in so-called ergative languages.4 Remarkably, the ‘faire-inﬁnitive’ causative of the Romance 
languages is not mentioned anywhere in the handbook, even though Woolford, in particular, is 
describing a pattern directly from the playbook of the Romance causative. On p. 215, Woolford 
lays her ﬁnger on the role of control in the split-ergative case system of Folopa, where ‘[i]f a per-
son uses the ergative [he] thus states his control’ over the situation (in the words of Anderson 
 
3 Especially interesting in connection with syntactic ergativity splits is Woolford’s discussion of predi-
cate-type-based split ergativity in Nepali (based on [Butt, Poudel 2007]), where individual-level (IL) 
transitive predicates have an ergative-marked subject whereas the subject of stage-level (SL) transi-
tives is nominative (p. 213). (On p. 214 Woolford notes that Nepali also has two different copulas for 
the IL and SL predicates — without drawing attention in this context to Spanish and Portuguese, which 
famously do, too.)
 
4 It may be relevant to note in this context that the 19th century missionary George Taplin, in his analysis 
of Ngarrindjeri, used the term ‘causative’ for what we would now call ‘ergative’ (see William McGre-
gor’s chapter, p. 453).

& Wade [1988: 11]). The role of control in split ergativity rears its head again on pp. 259 (Sa-
moan) and 267 (Lezgian), in Malchukov’s chapter. The parallel with the French ‘faire-inﬁni-
tive’ causative is hard to miss here: both in the functional literature (see especially [Huffmann 
1997]) and in generative work [Authier, Reed 1991], it has been pointed out that there is an ex-
plicit connection, particularly when the causee is a clitic, between the case of the causee and the 
degree of control exerted by it over the causativised event. We are plainly looking at the same 
phenomenon in both French and Folopa, Samoan and Lezgian.
This leads me to a more general point. In their introduction to the handbook (p. 3), the ed-
itors point out correctly that ‘not only do we ﬁnd non-ergative patterns throughout languages 
traditionally labeled “ergative,” we also ﬁnd ergative patterns in a number of language [sic 5] 
and domains normally considered “nominative–accusative.”’ But although at various points 
throughout the handbook there is discussion of the occurrence of ergative-like patterns in lan-
guages that do not generally show ergative–absolutive alignment, it seems to me that more 
could have been made of potentially profound parallels between familiar nominative–accusa-
tive patterns and things we ﬁnd in systems with ergative alignment. The classic hypothesis that 
the source of ergative alignment is the passive construction is brought up in several chapters — 
and it is roundly debunked by all authors who mention it. But the fact that the passive of, say, 
English singles out the notional subject of transitive clauses and marks it with a special case 
or preposition is not the only thing reminding one of ergativity in nominative–accusative sys-
tems. There are quite a few alternations in so-called nominative–accusative languages (in ad-
dition to the passive or the faire-causative already mentioned) in which a particular argument 
can be marked either with structural case or in some oblique way. The conative alternation (He 
ate (at) the meat), which conﬁnes itself to the object of transitive clauses, is mentioned explic-
itly by Polinsky in the context of a discussion of the antipassive (see pp. 325, 329) and is also 
brought up in passing by Coon & Preminger (p. 234) and in Mary Laughren’s chapter on War-
lpiri (the Warlpiri conative strikingly has an ergative-marked agent and a dative-marked object: 
p. 953). But Warlpiri’s rendition of The man shot the kangaroo with a riﬂe (Laughren, p. 953), 
which has two ergatives, one on ‘man’ and the other on ‘riﬂe’, seems to me much more inter-
esting. Laughren’s observation that ‘[i]n Warlpiri, the ergative-marking of instrument DPs 
is only grammatical if the subject is also marked ergative’ (p. 957), hence not in intransitive 
clauses, reminds one of the case alternation on the instrument argument in English He opened 
the door with the key and The key opened the door. Perhaps even more to the point is the case 
alternation on the cause argument seen in English alternations such as The door closed from 
the wind and The wind closed the door, which ﬁnds an exact match in two Samoan examples 
mentioned in Malchukov’s chapter (p. 259) — though unfortunately the parallel is missed due 
to the fact that Malchukov translates the locative case variant in the same way as the ergative 
 
5 This typo will serve as my cue for a few small remarks about some presentational imperfections of the 
handbook. In several places, names of linguists are misspelled (often with dogged persistence) — thus, 
Sheehan’s name is consistently misreproduced as ‘Sheenan’ in Laka’s chapter (which suffers from 
a variety of other typos as well), Altshuler’s name appears as ‘Artshuler’ and Depraetere’s as ‘Depreat-
ere’ in Nash’s chapter (the former but not the latter also shows up with the wrong spelling in the gen-
eral bibliography), and Pylkkänen’s name lacks its umlaut (‘Pylkkanen’) every time Kaufman’s chap-
ter makes mention of it. Another recurrent problem is the variable spelling of certain language names 
throughout the handbook (e. g., Ch’ol / Chol, Yup’ik / Yupik). On p. 249, in (39a), the gloss is mixed 
up (so’ should have been glossed as ‘am’ and magnate as ‘eaten’, rather than the other way round); but 
thankfully this is an example from Italian, a relatively familiar language, so probably most readers will 
be able to recover from this error. The occasional missing word hampers parsing of some sentences 
in the handbook (see e. g. the last sentence of the ﬁrst paragraph of the conclusion of Legate’s chap-
ter). Missing italicisation on some in-text citations of linguistic material (e. g. on p. 65) and omission 
of ﬁrst-line indentation at the start of several new paragraphs in chapter 22 will not affect readability 
but should also have been ﬁxed at the typesetting stage. Overall, however, considering the sheer size 
of this volume and the large number of contributors, the handbook looks excellent.

one. A translation with from would have been a useful segue to the relationship between erga-
tive case and directional P-elements such as English from, which is addressed elsewhere in the 
handbook — prominently in William McGregor’s chapter on the grammaticalisation of ergative 
case marking (see p. 449), in passing in Michelle Sheehan’s contribution (see p. 61), and also 
in an interesting way in Eva Schultze-Berndt’s discussion of the ablative in Jaminjung, which 
can mark the A-argument of a transitive clause with either the ergative or the ablative, depend-
ing on animacy and information structure (more on the latter below). The fact that English has 
a case alternation involving precisely the preposition from and ﬁnding a close parallel in some 
ergative case systems is surely indicative of the fact that there is no deep distinction between 
ergative and non-ergative languages.
Also worth exploring is the possible connection between Malchukov’s Lezgian example 
(p. 267) in which the ‘involuntary agent’ of the event is marked with adelative case (as opposed 
to the ergative case that the deliberate agent of the same event would bear) and English expe-
riential constructions such as The pot broke on Zamira. These English cases are striking not 
only for introducing with a preposition an argument higher on the Silverstein hierarchy than 
the nominative argument, but also for the fact that they alternate with have-sentences in which 
the theme is the accusative object and the ‘involuntary agent’ is the nominative subject, obliga-
torily ‘doubled’ by a pronoun inside a PP headed by on, as in Zamira had the pot break on her 
(see [Belvin 1996] for detailed discussion). Highly relevant in this context is the intriguing dif-
ference between the Shipibo rendition of My monkey died on me (where ‘monkey’ is marked 
ergative; p. 117) and the Yup’ik version of A bearded seal sank on that guy (with ‘guy’ marked 
ergative; p. 119), both taken from Mark Baker and Jonathan Bobaljik’s chapter. Though much 
will depend on how the language does ‘have’, what comes to mind is that the Yup’ik example 
is in fact the equivalent of the English have-sentence That guy had a bearded seal sink on him. 
The more closely one looks, the more parallels between English and ‘exotic’ ergative languages 
one is likely to ﬁnd.
If the suggestion made in the previous paragraph is on target, we are dealing in this Yup’ik 
example with the ergative–absolutive case pattern familiar from transitive sentences — but the 
noun phrase in the subject position of the have-sentence is probably a ������� subject (see al-
ready [Benveniste 1966], and more recently [Freeze 1992] and [Kayne 1993], on the syntax 
of have-constructions; Itziar Laka’s discussion of the Basque equivalent of need is also rele-
vant here). This is an important point because it bears directly on what is perhaps ��� major 
bone of contention in the literature on ergativity: the status of ergative case as an inherent case 
(most extensively defended in the handbook by Julie Legate) or as a dependent case in the sense 
of [Marantz 1991] (elucidated and advocated by Baker & Bobaljik, and seconded in Léa Nash’s 
chapter on Georgian). Tarald Taraldsen mentions (p. 341) a few languages that allow ergative 
derived subjects, singling out Hawrami [Holmberg, Odden 2004] as an interesting case in point: 
Hawrami has ergative–absolutive alignment in passivised double-object constructions, though 
not in passivised monotransitives. This is perfectly in line with Baker & Bobaljik’s dependent 
case approach: in passive double-object constructions there is case competition, forcing the de-
ployment of dependent (ergative) case, whereas in the passive of a monotransitive verb a single 
absolutive is sufﬁcient. Baker & Bobaljik devote careful attention, in connection with the in-
herent vs. dependent case distinction, to the occurrence of ergative on internal arguments, pre-
senting Shipibo as the primary case in point (but mentioning Kalaallisut, Chukchi and Yup’ik 
as well). Laughren observes that ‘[a]s in many other Australian languages, the ergative sufﬁx 
marks DPs in several non-subject roles in Warlpiri’ (p. 957) — indeed, Baker & Bobaljik assert 
that cross-linguistically ‘there is no type of theta-role that is totally immune to ergative case’ 
(p. 121). This all points squarely in the direction of the dependent case approach.
Yet, at the other end of the spectrum, Legate’s chapter draws attention to the important fact 
that ‘an absolutive object is not required for ergative case assignment’ (p. 143), although ‘[t]he 
presence of a complement �� relevant’ (p. 148, my emphasis). The availability of ergative case for 
the subject in the absence of an absolutive object is of course naturally expected on an inherent

approach to ergative case. The dependent case approach can accommodate this, for example, 
by postulating a silent object ‘taking’ absolutive case, but this raises non-trivial questions. How-
ever, the inherent case approach to the ergative faces an even larger question (to which [Polin-
sky 2016] offers a possible answer from an acquisition point of view): if ergative is an inherent 
case assigned by v to its speciﬁer, why don’t all languages have inherently case-marked external 
arguments of verbal predicates? Perhaps subscribers to an analysis of faire-causatives in which 
the dative causee has an inherent case assigned by v, or followers of Collins’ [2005] approach 
to the external argument of passives, would counter that in fact they do. But that would be a mis-
take, in part for the same reasons as the ones brought up by Baker & Bobaljik in connection with 
ergative case assignment: the dative causee of a faire-causative and the by-phrase of a passive 
can have a wide range of θ-roles.
As I see it, what ought to settle the debate between proponents of the inherent case approach 
to the ergative and the adherents of the dependent case perspective is that there is arguably 
no sense in which ergative could truly be an inherent case assigned by v and tied to a thematic 
role (or a cluster of θ-roles) assigned by v. At the heart of the matter is the fact that the source 
of the external argument’s θ-role is not v but the VP in its complement. We have known since 
Marantz’s [1984] cogent arguments to this effect that the nature of the θ-role borne by the subject 
of predication is determined compositionally by the verb and its complement together: in throw 
a ball and throw a ﬁt we are dealing with different θ-roles because the predicates are different 
(even though the verbs are the same). A major step forward in the v–VP approach to the struc-
ture of transitive sentences was precisely the ease with which the compositionality of external 
θ-role assignment is structurally encoded: v is the mediator of a predication relationship between 
VP (the predicate) and its external argument (in SpecvP), not a θ-role assigner. But if v is not 
a θ-role assigner, it cannot be an inherent case assigner either. This strikes me as a happy out-
come because I know of no convincing cases elsewhere in the grammar in which an �������� 
argument (i. e., a subject of predication) is assigned inherent case.
Particularly pertinent here is a brief examination of the genitive possessor of noun phrases. 
Though the literature on genitive case has erred frequently on this point (see e. g. [Chomsky 
1986]), it cannot be that the genitive is an inherent case — cross-linguistically it can be as-
signed to a wide variety of argument types, including internal arguments (Mary’s portrait); it 
can even be assigned to non-arguments (yesterday’s newspaper). There are frequent parallels 
across ergative languages between ergative and genitive case (a case in point is the so-called 
‘relative case’ of the Eskimo languages, which covers both). Besides the ergative case, the gen-
itive is really the only ��������� candidate for being an inherent case assigned to an external 
argument (of n in this case; see Artemis Alexiadou’s chapter for discussion of the nP structure 
of complex noun phrases, and also Edith Aldridge’s and Daniel Kaufman’s chapters for dis-
cussion of the relationship between nominality / nominalisation and ergativity). So the fact that 
the genitive case is ��� an ������ candidate for such a treatment casts a dark shadow on the 
prospect of an analysis of ergative case as inherent. It seems to me likely that the only assign-
ers of inherent case are prepositions — which may leave an opening for ergative case if there 
are languages for which the ergative is plausibly analysed as a P-assigned case. Judging from 
Nash’s assessment (see p. 190), such an approach is not viable for Georgian; but it may be right 
for other languages (see [Polinsky 2016]).
One last remark that I would like to make in the context of case assignment in languages 
with ergative–absolutive alignment concerns the structural height of the case assigners.6 There 
 
6 A question which I have no space to discuss at any length here is whether default case might play a role 
in ergative systems, as it does in nomative–accusative ones. In Longenbaugh & Polinsky’s chapter 
the possibility of there being two different ways of dealing with the absolutive case (as a default case 
or as the equivalent of nominative case) is brought up explicitly (p. 732). See also Taraldsen’s chapter 
for a brief and highly relevant remark (p. 350), and Austin’s chapter on the role of defaults in the ac-
quisition of Basque ergative and dative morphology.
156

is debate on this point in the literature for both ergative and absolutive case. Legate’s chapter 
addresses ergative case and structural height, arguing that the ergative argument is typically 
low in the structure (SpecvP). She leaves open the question of ‘whether true “high ergative” 
languages may be found’ (p. 157) — a tantalising question because, as Legate is right to stress 
on p. 135, there is a nomenclatural issue here: how is a “high ergative” language in which er-
gative is assigned by T and absolutive by v different from a nominative–accusative language? 
A language in which ergative and absolutive are ���� assigned by T would certainly be differ-
ent from a nominative–accusative one, for which v is indubitably the source of accusative case. 
In Michelle Sheehan’s chapter, the question of whether the source of absolutive case is parame-
trised (i. e., whether there are ‘low’ as well as ‘high’ absolutive languages) is reviewed brieﬂy, 
with reference to the relevant literature.
Related to the question of the structural height of the ergative and absolutive arguments is 
the relationship between ergativity and word order (especially the claim that ergative alignment 
does not go together with a basic SVO word order — ‘Mahajan’s generalisation’), as well as the 
important question of the information-structural proﬁle of sentences with ergative–absolutive 
alignment. On the former point, the reader will ﬁnd important discussion in Tarald Taraldsen’s 
contribution, and also in Ritsuko Kikusawa’s chapter, which argues (among other things) that one 
of the key factors resulting in a diachronic change in the case-alignment system is word-order 
change. In her chapter on ergativity in the languages of Africa, Christa König observes (p. 922) 
not only that in these languages ergativity is associated with ‘an unusual constituent order’ (viz., 
‘the odd OVA / SV order’), but also that its occurrence is conﬁned to ‘pragmatically marked con-
structions’ — in particular, ‘the pragmatic marking of topicalized or focused objects’, or, perhaps 
more accurately, the marking of contrastiveness, which topics and foci can both be associated 
with (see also the discussion in Schultze-Berndt’s chapter of the role of contrastiveness or un-
expectedness in the case-marking of agents in Jaminjung; pp. 1106–1109).
The connection between ergativity and information structure plays a signiﬁcant role in Alana 
Johns and Ivona Kučerová’s chapter, and especially in John Du Bois’s contribution, which takes 
a functionalist and highly comparative approach that I found a real eye-opener to a very complex 
and timely topic. Starting off with a close reading of a story fragment from Sakapultek (Mayan), 
Du Bois observes that ‘the discourse distribution of lexical [as opposed to pro-dropped — MdD] 
arguments (and of new information) corresponds to the absolutive category in the grammar 
of ergative languages, while topically continuous elements are found in what would be the sub-
ject in accusative languages’ (p. 29) — a conclusion that he subsequently conﬁrms on the ba-
sis of an examination of a wide range of other languages from several families. The picture that 
emerges is that, whereas in nominative–accusative alignment patterns the bearer of the unmarked 
case (nominative) is usually topical, in ergative systems new information is paired with un-
marked case (absolutive). Malchukov’s observations on p. 265 conﬁrm this for some languages 
not mentioned by Du Bois; but the generalisation that ergative-marked transitive subjects are 
overwhelmingly deﬁnite and given appears to be counterexempliﬁed by Ika, Gooniyandi and 
Newari (pp. 263–264). The complete picture is no doubt more complex than broad brushstrokes 
can paint — just as it is with nominative–accusative alignment. The message here is that discus-
sions of the information-structural proﬁle of ergative alignment systems are strongly encouraged, 
and should invite an integrated investigation that also encompasses differential object marking 
(see Coon & Preminger’s, Malchukov’s and Butt & Deo’s chapters), object shift (see especially 
Woolford’s pp. 221–222), and ‘scrambling’ phenomena more generally (including extraposition). 
All of these are known to have a cocktail of morphological, word-order and information-struc-
tural effects. For a small subset of the world’s languages, the interactions between these effects 
are beginning to be understood to quite an advanced degree. It is a very welcome development 
that they are garnering more and more careful attention in studies of ergative systems as well.
In a short review of a book totalling well over a thousand pages of densely packed text and 
a huge wealth of information, I obviously cannot do justice to everything that is being discussed. 
In the present paragraph and the next, I will merely highlight, by way of invitations for further

research, two other themes that stand out in the handbook. The ﬁrst is diachronic development 
and its directionality. There is ongoing debate in the literature on Oceanic languages (dating back 
to the 1970s; see [Chung 1978]) about the direction of alignment change. According to Kiku-
sawa, in Austronesian and Oceanic languages there is a ‘general ﬂow of ergative to accusative 
change’ (p. 587), although ����� the completion of such change some Oceanic languages un-
derwent a more recent change from accusative back to ergative. In the Austronesian context, the 
developmental relationship between ergativity and the complex voice systems that many of these 
languages are known for is also an important matter. Mitcho Erlewine, Ted Levin & Coppe van 
Urk’s chapter concludes on this point that ‘ergativity cannot be the only route to a voice system’ 
(p. 395). More work on this is called for.
A second invitation for research emerges from Martina Wiltschko’s contribution, which is 
so programmatic (in the author’s own words) that it rather stands out in this handbook. Wiltsch-
ko’s chapter argues that ‘ergative constellations are detectable in the syntax of speech acts’ 
(p. 441), helping to mark relations between speaker and hearer and their commitment to the 
proposition. The interesting Nez Perce data that William McGregor presents on pp. 457–458 
of his chapter ﬁt into Wiltschko’s programme like a hand in a glove. I mention this connection 
here because readers who look in isolation at either Wiltschko’s or McGregor’s chapter (which 
are consecutive but separated by the split between Parts II and III of the handbook) may not re-
alise that the other chapter contains highly relevant information: unfortunately these chapters 
contain no cross-references to one another.
The relative dearth of cross-references between chapters is one of the minor ﬂaws of the 
handbook as a whole. Perhaps a little bit more editing could have been done to enhance the co-
hesion of the volume. One also notices that there is quite a bit of overlap between individual 
chapters, which becomes mildly annoying after a while to readers (such as your reviewer) go-
ing through the handbook linearly.7 But few readers are likely to consume the handbook linearly 
from cover to cover, so this redundancy may be a blessing rather than a curse. On a related note, 
a welcome exercise in cross-chapter editing would have placed the various individual disprov-
als of the passive as the source of ergative alignment (ﬁguring prominently in three successive 
contributions to Part III (chapters 20–22) but at other points in the volume as well) in one sin-
gle location in the handbook.8
As the editors point out in their introduction, ‘the approaches of the authors and the scope 
of the studies vary considerably’ (p. 14). There is some variability in the quality of the hand-
book’s individual contributions as well. Most are superb, but a few chapters strike me as sub-par, 
and some contributions seem to me out of place, being more like research papers than handbook 
pieces.9 And although it is a very good thing that there are sections dedicated to language acqui-
sition and experimental approaches in the handbook, the three chapters in the acquisition section 
are, unfortunately, not particularly robust. On the other hand, Adam Zawiszewski’s short digest 
of sentence-processing studies of ergative systems is a useful prelude to Nicholas Longenbaugh 
 
7 For instance, in chapter 23, halfway into the handbook, we are suddenly presented again with a text-
book-style, paragraph-long exposé of what ergativity is (p. 553), complete with a footnote deﬁning the 
by now very familiar labels ‘A’ (for ‘agent of transitive verbs’), ‘P’ (‘patient of transitive verbs’), and 
‘S’ (‘subject of intransitive verbs’).
 
8 Another small point of criticism is that neither the editors, in their introduction, nor any of the other 
contributors discusses the origin of the term ‘ergative’. We encounter the term ‘ergator’ (not included 
in the index) once, as an alternate name for the ‘A’ argument in a quote from England [1991:484] pre-
sented in Du Bois’s chapter (p. 40).
 
9 Chapter 3 is a somewhat superﬁcial exercise in parameter hierarchies, not very helpful in a broader con-
text. Chapter 4 makes a simple (though very valid) point, but is really more like a research paper than 
a handbook chapter (and it could perhaps have been an appendix to the other chapter on Hindi/Urdu). 
Chapter 7 is extremely narrow in scope. Chapter 12 is rather too technical and idiosyncratic for a hand-
book piece. Chapter 15 is a recital of (mostly the author’s own) work on nominalisation, which chap-
ters 21 and 24 do a much better job at relating directly to ergativity.

and Maria Polinsky’s chapter on the processing of subject-gap and object-gap relative clauses 
in split-ergative systems, showing how the two central hypotheses regarding the processing 
of relative clauses (the subject processing advantage hypothesis, and the case-cueing hypothe-
sis), while aligned in nominative–accusative patterns, make different predictions in split-erga-
tive systems. These two chapters should serve as a helpful guide to anyone interested in adding 
to the (modestly) burgeoning volume of experimental studies performed on languages with er-
gative alignment.10
The editors ‘have done [their] best to include chapters representing a range of different the-
oretical and methodological traditions, though, as with any volume, imbalances reﬂecting the 
orientation of the editors nonetheless exist’ (p. 2). These imbalances did not strike me as serious. 
The handbook presents a veritable who’s who of the ﬁeld of ergativity studies enlivened with 
occasional contributions from relative outsiders whose out-of-the-box thinking about ergativity 
places the central questions in this realm in a broader perspective (as John Du Bois aptly puts 
it, ‘[e]rgativity is too important to be left to the specialists of ergative languages’; p. 57). Here 
I am thinking, for instance, of Tarald Taraldsen’s exercise in questions of the general type ‘if x 
is true of ergative systems, what are x’s implications and roots?’. As an illustration of Tarald-
sen’s dialectic approach, let me point to p. 340, where we ﬁnd the following passage (somewhat 
condensed here): ‘If the generalization does hold for tripartite languages, we conclude that the 
generalization really is to be understood as *SErgVO, but if it doesn’t, the generalization must be 
*SVOAbs. If the generalization is valid for neutral languages with Erg / Abs agreement patterns, 
we conclude that the generalization is really about syntactic case … If the active agreement 
pattern reﬂects underlying Active / Inactive … case alignment …, one may conjecture that 
*SErgVOAbs doesn’t hold for active languages … If a suitably precise version of the *SErgVOAbs 
generalization holds, one will ask why … If SVO order is merely incompatible with assign-
ment of syntactic absolutive case to the object …, there should be tripartite SVO languages 
… But if SVO order is incompatible with the subject surfacing with ergative case, there should 
be no tripartite SVO languages … At present, however, no conclusion can be drawn from this, 
since the data available to me seems insufﬁcient.’ 11
All things considered, The Oxford Handbook of Ergativity is a splendid resource and a proud 
testament to the achievements of the many linguists who have made empirical and analytical 
contributions to ergativity in all its many hues. Logically organised and jam-packed with data 
and analyses, this is the place to go for specialists, ‘accidental tourists’ (in the words of Lon-
genbaugh and Polinsky; p. 710), and anyone who has ever had a burning question about erga-
tivity but was afraid to ask it: here are the answers, and plenty of food for thought and avenues 
for future research into the bargain.
Acknowledgement
I would like to express my deep gratitude to Masha Polinsky for offering me a copy of the 
handbook, suggesting my name to the review editor of this journal (whom I thank for the in-
vitation), and providing excellent comments on a ﬁrst draft of this piece. The pointed remarks 
of an anonymous reviewer also led to improvements. The responsibility for any misrepresenta-
tions of the facts presented and views expressed in the handbook is entirely mine.
 10 Longenbaugh & Polinsky’s chapter is also noteworthy for containing new studies of Niuean and Avar. 
In this context, I would also like to highlight the novel discussion of Dinka Bor in Erlewine et al.’s 
chapter, and the fact that Kaufman’s contribution features original material on Mamuju, a language not 
previously described at any length.
 11 Readers interested in tripartite (or three-way) systems may ﬁnd it useful to know that Gereon Müller 
and Daniela Thomas argue in their chapter that tripartite systems do not exist.
