Persian ezāfe as a contact-induced feature

Abstract: The paper addresses the origin of the right-branching morphosyntactic pattern known as the 
ezāfe construction, which permeates the Persian noun phrase syntax. In Section 1, I attempt to demon-
strate that this construction poses challenges for word order typology. Furthermore, it represents a de-
viation from the pattern of left-branching, predominant in the nominal syntax of those modern Iranian 
languages that avoided intensive contacts with Persian. In Section 2, I extend the analysis to Old and 
Middle Iranian and argue that the right-branching construction with the relative pronoun haya- / taya- 
functioning as a linker, the ancestor of the later ezāfe construction, was grammaticized in Old Persian. 
Section 3 constitutes the core of this paper, and presents arguments for the inﬂ uence of the Elamite lan-
guage on syntactic restructuring in Old Persian. First, Elamite shares with Persian the unusual combina-
tion of the basic SOV word order and right-branching nominal syntax. Second, Elamite constructions 
with class agreement could plausibly be calqued by noun phrases with the Old Persian relative pronoun 
haya- / taya- in the linking function. Third, the demonstrable language shift from Elamite to Iranian 
along the northern shore of the Persian Gulf in the ﬁ rst millennium BCE provides a suitable sociolin-
guistic correlate for partial syntactic restructuring in Old Persian. Section 4 tackles the arguments for 
Urartian, alongside Elamite, aﬀ ecting Iranian nominal syntax, and pleads for their inconclusive charac-
ter. Section 5 addresses noun phrases in Bactrian, Khwarezmian, and Younger Avestan, which may po-
tentially be used as evidence against the proposed scenario, and oﬀ ers their alternative interpretations.

порядка слов, а также ее контраст c левоветвящимися именными синтагмами, которые харак-
терны для большинства иранских языков, не подверженных интенсивному влиянию персидского. 
Во втором разделе, посвященном анализу соответствующих именных словосочетаний в древне- 
и среднеиранских языках, делается вывод о грамматикализации правоветвящейся конструкции 
с относительным местоимением haya-/taya- в качестве связки, предка современной изафетной 
конструкции, в древнеперсидском языке. Ядром настоящей статьи является ее третий раздел, обо-
сновывающий гипотезу о синтаксической перестройке древнеперсидского языка под эламским 
влиянием. Во-первых, эламский язык обнаруживает нетривиальное сочетание базового порядка 
слов SOV и правого ветвления в именной системе, характерное также и для древнеперсидского. 
Во-вторых, использование относительного местоимения haya-/taya- в функции связки в древне-
персидском языке может являться калькой эламского механизма классного согласования. В-тре-
тьих, несомненный переход носителей эламского языка на иранские языки в регионе к северу 
от Персидского залива в первом тысячелетии до н. э. обеспечивает социолингвистические пред-
посылки для контактно-обусловленных синтаксических изменений в древнеперсидском. В чет-
вертом разделе обсуждается вопрос о возможном влиянии урартского языка, наряду с эламским, 
на эволюцию иранского именного синтаксиса и делается вывод о бездоказательном характере 
данной гипотезы. В пятом разделе разбираются примеры бактрийских, хорезмийских и младо-
авестийских именных словосочетаний, которые могут cлужить потенциальными аргументами 
против предложенного сценария, и предлагаются их альтернативные интерпретации.

1. Noun phrase in New Iranian
A feature of the Persian language which remains stable from the classical period onwards is 
the right-branching nominal syntax. The dependent nouns recursively follow their syntactic heads, 
while the adjectives precede the nouns depending on the same head. A special linker, known 
as the ezāfe in Persian grammatical tradition, is placed between the head and the dependent and 
cliticized to the head.1 In the absence of the grammatical case category in Persian, this device 
represents the primary means of ensuring cohesion within a noun phrase. Examples (1)–(3) are 
taken from the Classical Persian poets Rudaki, Ferdowsi and Hafez respectively, but neither the 
poetic character nor the medieval origin of the respective compositions impact the nature of the 
ezāfe construction. In modern prose or colloquial language, it remains essentially the same, ex-
cept that the shape of the ezāfe particle is -e rather than -i in contemporary Persian (Farsi) and 
Dari of Afghanistan, while in Tajiki it stays as -i. There is a scholarly consensus that this particle 
goes back to the Proto-Iranian relative pronoun [Haider, Zwanziger 1984, with further references].

1 A more detailed synchronic discussion of the Persian ezāfe construction, accompanied by numerous 
examples, can be found in [Rubinchik 2001: 365–368]. Note that the Arabic iḍāfa and the Turkish iza-
fet have nothing in common with the Persian ezāfe except the name (which is Arabic in origin). These 
are three diﬀ erent ways of organizing nominal syntax in the respective languages.

As one can infer from examples (1) and (3), the right-branching ezāfe constructions coexist 
with the basic SOV word order in Persian. Nevertheless, it represents a typologically non-trivial 
feature, as noted already in [Greenberg 1963: 67], where Persian is listed under the rare Type 17. 
The seminal work of Matthew S. Dryer on word order in the world’s languages contains a sam-
ple of 124 languages characterized by the OV word order, out of which 112 show the prepo-
sition of the nominal possessor to the head noun, while only 12 feature the possessor in the 
postposition [Dryer 1992: 91]. The statistics of [Dryer, Haspelmath 2013] lists 26 languages 
characterized by the correlation Noun-Genitive / SOV, as opposed to 249 languages featuring 
Noun-Genitive / SVO, 106 languages featuring Genitive-Noun / SVO, and 398 languages fea-
turing Genitive-Noun / SOV (https://wals.info/combinations/86A_81A#2/24.9/153.0).
Within the Iranian family, Persian is not the only language with the ezāfe construction as the 
principal way of organizing nominal syntax. It is prevalent in the West Iranian languages Kurd-
ish and Zazaki, where the linker is notoriously inﬂ ected [Eﬁ mov 1975: 78–82]. It is also funda-
mental to Dari and Tajiki, the erstwhile varieties of Persian whose development into independent 
languages was precipitated by sociolinguistic factors, as well as to several vernaculars of Iran, 
which lack written tradition and have been developing under the inﬂ uence of Persian in the last 
two centuries. Based on the analysis of this set one can conclude that the ezāfe construction was 
at home on the western margin of the Iranian-speaking area, at least before the spread of Per-
sian to Central Asia in the Early Islamic period complicated the picture.2
In contrast, the majority of the modern Iranian languages with limited restructuring under 
Persian inﬂ uence display the typologically common pattern of SOV word order combined with 
the preposition of the dependent noun in noun phrases (“Genitive-Noun”). Such a state of af-
fairs can be illustrated with reference to the West Iranian language Balochi (4), as well as the 
East Iranian languages Wakhi (5) and Ossetic (6). This genetic diversity correlates with a wide 
geographic spread: the Balochi language is spoken at the border of Afghanistan and Pakistan, 
the Wakhi language is at home in the Pamir Mountains, while the Ossetians inhabit parts of the 
Caucasus. The selection of examples here is admittedly subjective; for a more comprehensive 
list of languages that display the same correlations one should consult [Stilo 2005: 47–51].

2 The so called “inverted ezāfe” construction, which exists in certain Northwest Iranian languages of the 
Caspian area, was recently treated in [Ivanov, Dodykhudoeva 2017]. Its typical examples are Mazan-
derani noun phrases Hosayn-e ketāb ‘Husein’s book’, serx-e jeme ‘red shirt’. Unlike its Persian coun-
terpart, this construction is left-branching, for example, the adjective serx ‘red’ precedes the noun jeme 
‘shirt’. One can agree with the authors of this paper that the “inverted ezāfe” is typologically more sim-
ilar to a linker than case marker, in particular because it can be deployed in both possessive construc-
tions and adjectival phrases. In historical terms, however, there is every reason to accept the traditional 
analysis of Mazanderani -e as the reﬂ ex of the Iranian genitive case in *-ahya, which underwent func-
tional extension on the model of the ezāfe particle as a result of syntactic interference with Persian. 
Since the native speakers of Mazanderani and other Caspian languages are usually bilingual in Persian, 
this convergence is sociolinguistically motivated. On the other hand, as argued in the rest of this paper, 
the antecedents of the ezāfe construction show the right-branching word order from the Achaemenid 
period onwards, and the reversal of this pattern in the Caspian languages would lack any motivation. 
Alternatively, as suggested by one of the reviewers, the “inverted ezāfe” after the attributive adjectives 
may simply continue an old suﬃ  x (cf. the suﬃ  x -ēn marking the attributive adjectives in West Balochi). 
Therefore, this construction is tangential to the main argument of this paper and will not be treated here 
in any more detail.

So far we have seen that the ezāfe construction of the Persian type, on the one hand, is typo-
logically unusual, and, on the other hand, was historically conﬁ ned to a particular area of the 
Iranian spread zone. Therefore, one can formulate a preliminary hypothesis that it represents 
an innovation, which has to be tested through the analysis of additional data.
2. Historical perspective
So far we have conﬁ ned ourselves to the discussion of the New Iranian languages, spoken 
from the time of the Islamic conquests onwards. The distribution becomes clearer once one 
takes into consideration the ﬁ ve best attested Middle Iranian languages, used in writing in the 
ﬁ rst millennium CE. Only one of them, namely Middle Persian, displays the right-branching 
ezāfe construction (linker ī or perhaps ē) as the most common way of organizing nominal syntax 
(7). Nevertheless, even in this language it coexists with the alternative strategy of left-branch-
ing, which does not require any linker, and is essentially the same as illustrated by New Ira-
nian examples (4)–(6). Thus, the phrase wāxš ī hwarāsān wimand ‘spirit of the Khorasan fron-
tier’ ([Boyce 1975: 40], M2.I § 4.1) embeds the dependent-head constituent hwarāsān wimand 
‘frontier of Khorasan’ into the ezāfe construction. For various types of noun phrases where the 
ezāfe construction was in use in Middle Persian, see [Boyce 1964: 37–47] and [Durkin-Meis-
terernst 2014: 268–271].

‘Door of eyes (= sight), which is deceived at an empty vision (= mirage)’ (M 2 I § 7.1, 
[Boyce 1975: 41]).
The other four Middle Iranian languages, namely Parthian (8), Sogdian (9), Bactrian (10), 
and Khotanese (11), all select left-branching without a linker as the main strategy of forming 
noun phrases. This does not exclude the existence of alternative patterns, such as right-branch-
ing with the linker čē in Parthian Manichaean texts, but “its absence is commoner than its use” 
[Boyce 1964: 32].3

3 For the discussion of Classical Armenian relative clauses without overt predicates and their possible 
areal connections, see [Meyer 2017: 208]. Whether the Parthian inﬂ uence was responsible in whole 
or in part for the existence of such constructions in Classical Armenian remains unclear, but even if it 
did, the elliptical relative clauses introduced by the Parthian particle kē represent a more likely source 
of inspiration than the ezāfe construction with the particle čē.

‘The karmic heap of this being…’ (SghS. §̣ 35.2, [Canevascini 1993: 16]).
It is relevant for this discussion that Parthian is a Northwest Iranian language, whereas Bac-
trian, Sogdian and Khotanese belong to the East Iranian group. The Parthian language was pre-
sumably at home to the southeast of the Caspian Sea, at the border of the present-day Iran and 
Turkmenistan; Bactrian was spoken on the territory of Northern Afghanistan, Sogdian in Tajik-
istan and Uzbekistan, and Khotanese in Xinjiang, China. This genetic and geographic diversity 
conﬁ rms the impression that the dependent-head word order was the most common one in the 
Iranian-speaking area and is to be reconstructed as prototypical for Proto-Iranian nominal syntax.
It is useful to explore this hypothesis further by considering the data of the Old Iranian 
languages. In Old Persian, attested through the Achaemenid royal inscriptions of the 6th–4th 
centuries BCE, there are two principal ways of organizing nominal syntax. These are either 
left-branching phrases, which do not require any linker, as in the predicate group of (12), or their 
right-branching counterparts, where the syntactic head and dependent are linked by the pronoun 
haya- / taya-, which agrees in gender, number, and case with the head, as in (13). In historical 
terms, haya- / taya- represents a combination of the demonstrative pronoun *ha- / *ta- and rela-
tive pronoun *ya-, but synchronically it is also deployed as the head of normal relative clauses 
[Skjærvø 2009: 154].4 The right-branching constructions with the linker display a wide variety 
of syntactic subtypes, e.g. XPf. 30 dārayavauš haya manā pitā ‘Darius, my father’, DB. I 88–
89 avam kāram tayam Nadintabairahyā ‘that army of Nadintu-Bel’, DB. I 80–81 xšaçam taya 
Babirau ‘the kingship in Babylon’.

‘This kingdom from the beginning belonged to our family’ (DB. I 45, [Schmitt 2009: 43]).

‘My army smote the rebellious army at will’ (DB. II 25–26 [Schmitt 2009: 54]).
There is a tendency to deploy the variant with the linker to mark the pragmatically familiar 
entities. Thus ‘our family’ in (12) constitutes new information: Darius, the author of the Bisitun 
 
4 The pronoun haya- / taya- is formally diﬀ erent from *ya-, which is traditionally reconstructed as the an-
cestor of the ezāfe particle in Middle and New Persian. This discrepancy is usually understood as a tes-
timony to the possibility of unique innovations in the language of Achaemenid elites. For justifying the 
rise of the morpheme cluster ha-ya- / ta-ya- in functional terms, see [Adiego 2000]. The recent attempt 
to derive the relative pronoun and linker haya- / taya- via reanalysis of the demonstrative pronoun *ha-/
ta- [Brust 2018: 194] does not take into consideration the syntactic properties of haya- / taya-, which 
set it apart from a prototypical article or demonstrative pronoun (cf. the discussion above). On the other 
hand, Nicholas Sims-Williams (pers. comm.) draws my attention to a possibility of deriving the Middle 
Persian ezāfe particle directly from haya-, with the irregular loss of h- in a clitic formation. He speci-
ﬁ es that the derivation of this morpheme from haya- vs. *ya- should be regarded as an open question.

inscription, makes a signiﬁ cant (and probably false) claim that he represents a legitimate heir 
to the throne. On the contrary, ‘my army’ and ‘rebellious army’ in (13) represent information 
established in the immediately preceding discourse.5 Such a quasi-anaphoric use is perhaps why 
the element haya- / taya- is sometimes called “article” in secondary literature on Old Persian, 
even though such a designation is ultimately misleading.6 The construction kāra haya manā is 
commonly regarded as the antecedent of the ezāfe construction in later Persian. It is restricted 
to the nominative, accusative and ablative-instrumental cases and never occurs in genitive-da-
tive, cf. [Probert 2015: 412, with further references].
The basic Old Persian word order at the clause level is SOV [Kent 1953: 96; Skjærvø 2009: 
94]. In this sense, it is no diﬀ erent from modern Farsi, or for that matter, from the majority of the 
other Iranian languages. It is more diﬃ  cult to generalize about the basic syntax of the Old Per-
sian noun phrase. Both patterns head-dependent and dependent-head are abundantly repre-
sented there, with a vague pragmatic distribution (see above). Since the ﬁ rst pattern correlated 
with the use of an extra pronoun, it can be considered as formally marked. In essence, the syn-
tax of the Achaemenid inscription can be compared with that of Attic Greek prose, where the 
right-branching construction with the repetition of the article ἡ ἐπιθυμία ἡ τοῦ ὕδατος ‘the de-
sire for water’ constitutes a marked alternative to the synonymous left-branching phrase ἡ τοῦ 
ὕδατος ἐπιθυμία. If so, the basic syntax of Old Persian reﬂ ects the typologically trivial pattern 
SOV /  Genitive-Noun, which also happens to characterize the majority of the Iranian languages. 
While the ancestor of the ezāfe construction represented a periphrastic alternative to the nor-
mal state of aﬀ airs, it became approximately as frequent as the inherited left-branching noun 
phrase in Old Persian.
The other directly attested Old Iranian language is Avestan. It seems appropriate to focus our 
analysis on the Old Avestan language, because the subsequent stages in the development of the 
Avesta are increasingly suspect of interference from the Old/Middle Persian vernacular (cf. Sec-
tion 5). On the other hand, the poetic character of the Old Avestan compositions imposes hur-
dles on our ability to discern their basic syntax. Nevertheless, it is said that the most common 
pattern at the clause level is SOV [West 2011: 116] and, at least in the Yasna Haptaŋhāiti, the 
dependent genitives tend to precede their head nouns [West 2011: 123)].
Nevertheless, the sequence of elements that would eventually develop into the ezāfe in Per-
sian is already present in Old Avestan, albeit as an exceptional pattern. The Avestan relative pro-
noun ya-, cognate with the second component of Old Persian ha-ya- / ta-ya-, is found on rare oc-
casions as a noun phrase linker in constructions with right-branching. The diﬀ erence between 
such noun phrases and verbless relative clauses consists in the fact that the relative pronouns 
in these constructions agree in case with their nominal antecedents. The function of the relative 
in (14) and (15) was synchronically compared with the linking function of the Classical Greek 
article [West 2011: 82]. Historically, however, there is little doubt that these Old Avestan ex-
amples reﬂ ect secondary case attraction in verbless relative clauses [Probert 2015: 410-412].
 
5 The distinction between the ways of marking deﬁ nite vs. indeﬁ nite noun phrases apparently lingers 
on in the history of Persian. Thus, Early Judaeo-Persian, representing an intermediate stage between 
Middle and Classical Persian, displays tendencies toward the word order Adjective-Noun in indeﬁ nite 
noun phrases [Paul 2013: 155]. According to [Brunner 1977: 18], a minimal pair in the Middle Persian 
legal treatise Hazār dādestān (“Thousand Judgments”) suggests a contrast between the left-branching 
order in the indeﬁ nite noun phrase ‘Farrox’s sons and descendants’ (any of them) and the right-branch-
ing order in the deﬁ nite noun phrase ‘the sons and descendants of Farrox’ (those mentioned here).
 
6 As already observed in [Kent 1953: 85], there are several cases where haya- / taya- is placed in front 
of the noun phrase, and the dependent precedes its head. For example, the phrase ‘our family’ is also 
attested as haya amāxam taumā (DB. I 8). Furthermore, there are instances where haya- / taya- deter-
mines a single constituent e.g. taya rastam ‘(what is) right’ (DNa. 7). Notwithstanding this, haya- / taya- 
is hardly a prototypical article: it normally cannot be combined with free-standing nouns in the same 
grammatical case, while its combinations with free-standing adjectives can be regarded as instances 
of ellipsis.

The diﬀ erence between the situations in Old Avestan and Old Persian is that the construc-
tion with the relative pronoun functioning as a linker does not yet exhibit a stable pattern in the 
former case. Examples (14) and (15) lack precise parallels in the rest of the corpus and can be 
characterized as ﬁ gures of speech. Neither are they parallel to one another: the demonstrative 
pronoun is present in (15) but not in (14). The majority of Old Avestan noun phrases with the 
postposition of the dependent element do not feature any linker [West 2011: 123], while the most 
common use of ya- outside the relative clauses is that of a determiner with no implied linking 
function [West 2011: 82].
This is the expected state of aﬀ airs, since the Old Avestan language was still very close to the 
reconstructed Common Iranian, while the innovative ezāfe construction otherwise characterizes 
a particular area of the Iranian spread zone. The frequent use of the relative pronoun as a linker 
can ﬁ rst be discerned in Old Persian, while the relevant construction acquires the default sta-
tus in Middle Persian and becomes near-obligatory in the contemporary Persian language. It re-
mains to be seen to what extent this process of gradual change is compatible with the inﬂ uence 
of external factors.
3. Elamite inﬂ uence
The idea that the development of the Persian ezāfe construction may be contact-induced is 
in itself not new. Thus, the introduction to the latest inﬂ uential compendium of Iranian linguis-
tics contains the following observations: “The two documented non-Iranian languages which 
the earliest immigrating Persian and Median tribes encountered in the west sometime before the 
8th century BCE are Urartian at the northern end of the “Zagros” tier, and Elamite at its south-
ern end. Both Urartian and Elamite were right-branching languages. Therefore the Elamite ty-
pology has been recognized as the likely source of the innovative Old Persian relative construc-
tion N haya X ‘N who (is) X’, which in turn is the source for the ezāfe in the Perside languages. 
Similarly, the likely source at the northern end of the “Zagros” tier was the equally right-branch-
ing Urartian typology” [Windfuhr 2009: 28]. Windfuhr’s assumption is also followed in a re-
cent Berkeley Ph.D. thesis devoted to the genealogical classiﬁ cation of the Iranian languages 
[Cathcart 2015: 43].
While areal inﬂ uence at the margin of the Iranian spread zone is plausible, nobody would 
surely doubt the possibility of the formation of a new noun phrase pattern due to internal fac-
tors. The mere convergence between two right-branching constructions is not statistically signif-
icant in itself, because right-branching characterizes about ﬁ fty percent of the world’s languages. 
What strengthens the suspicion of external inﬂ uence is the fact that the development of the con-
struction N haya X eventually yielded a typologically unusual syntactic pattern (see Section 1 
above). The basic intuition here is that “languages that do not meet the expectations of implica-
tional universals are often found between two languages, groups of languages, or language areas 
that are more or less opposite to each other” [Stilo 2005: 38]. Thus, in purely synchronic terms, 
one can claim that modern Persian represents a transitional case between the dialects of Arabic, 
with their right-branching, and the languages of Central and South Asia, with their left-branch-
ing. The same point is stressed in [Haig 2015: 409] with reference to Kurdish and North-East-
ern Neo-Aramaic, exhibiting similar patterns of syntactic discrepancy.

From the historical perspective, this synchronic picture is again no more than a ﬁ rst approx-
imation. We know that Sumerian and Elamite, language isolates of the Ancient Near East, dis-
played the same combination of SOV and the head-dependent order in the noun phrase already 
before the Iranian migrations to the present-day Western Iran in the early ﬁ rst millennium BCE. 
The hypothesis that they likewise represented transitional systems at the time is plausible but not 
provable: while we know that the West Semitic languages were predominantly right-branching 
already in the second millennium BCE, the languages that were then spoken on the Iranian pla-
teau are simply unknown to us. But the situation in Ancient Mesopotamia oﬀ ers a suggestive 
typological parallel to the syntactic change addressed in this paper: Akkadian, a Semitic lan-
guage that coexisted there with Sumerian in the third and second millennia BCE, features the 
same typologically marked combination SOV / Noun-Genitive. Despite some voices of dissent, 
most scholars agree with the claim that the Akkadian word order represents an innovation vis-
à-vis the common Semitic pattern VSO ~ SVO / Noun-Genitive, which was due to the Sume-
rian substrate [Zólyomi 2011: 402, with further references]. Indeed, this example is cited as one 
of the paradigmatic cases of syntactic change caused by language contact [Thomason 2001: 88].7
Therefore, for the purpose of the present discussion, I shall replace Stilo’s maxim with the 
following claim: “languages that do not meet the expectations of implicational universals are 
suspect of having undergone partial restructuring as a result of substrate or adstrate interfer-
ence”. This broad formulation obviously encompasses situations where both the trigger and tar-
get of restructuring are assumed to have met the expectations of implicational universals, as well 
as the persistence of mixed types in a speciﬁ c area. In particular, we shall explore the scenario 
according to which Elamite, itself a language of the mixed syntactic type, aﬀ ected the dialects 
on the southwestern periphery of the Iranian spread zone, which were originally left-branch-
ing, just as the rest of the Iranian languages. In order to substantiate this hypothesis it is neces-
sary to demonstrate the presence of necessary sociolinguistic conditions for structural contact 
as well as non-trivial similarity between the noun phrases that supposedly triggered and under-
went restructuring.
It is customary to distinguish between two basic modes of language contact involving the 
situations of language maintenance and language shift. The ﬁ rst situation primarily correlates 
with the transfer of elements (most commonly, lexical borrowings), the second one is primar-
ily compatible with structural interference. To be sure, the correlation is not quite strict: there 
are arrested language shifts, which involve the last-minute re-borrowing from the disappearing 
languages (e.g. the dialects of the “pygmies” in West Africa), and the instances of asymmetri-
cal bilingualism, where the eﬀ ects on the minority language or basilect are reminiscent of the 
outcome of language shift (e.g. Asia Minor Greek). But in the majority of cases, partial restruc-
turing of Language A (or a dialect of A) under the inﬂ uence of Language B is indicative of the 
shift from B to A (e.g. from Gaelic to English in Ireland). The robust character of restructuring 
frequently correlates with the short phase of bilingualism and the imperfect learning of A. These 
theoretical facts are summarized in Table 1, adapted after [Ross 1991].
 
7 Another case of substrate interference in the ancient Near East yielding a typologically rare syntactic 
pattern is arguably that of Hattian, a non-aﬃ  liated language that was spoken in Central Anatolia in the 
early second millennium BCE. According to the analysis of [Goedegebuure 2008], Hattian is proto-
typically a right-branching language, but with numerous deviations from the ideal patterns. Goedege-
buure explains this state of aﬀ airs by the interference of the Indo-European Anatolian languages of the 
early second millennium BCE, which are commonly reconstructed as left-branching.
The next task is to apply the framework outlined above to the coexistence between Iranian 
and Elamite, as recently outlined in [Tavernier 2018]. The Elamite language was used in writ-
ing on a territory stretching from the eastern extension of the Mesopotamian alluvial plain 
(the area of Susa, present-day Khuzestan) to the highlands of Fars. In the second millennium 
BCE, there is no evidence for the presence of Iranian speakers in this area, while Elamite com-
petes with Akkadian and Sumerian in the written sphere, in particular, in the regions situated

closer to Mesopotamia. The ﬁ rst Iranian personal names appear in the Elamite sources in the 
seventh century BCE and become more numerous in the early sixth century. The relevant docu-
ments, however, are all composed in Elamite, and the local rulers mentioned in the texts of this 
period bear Elamite names. This underscores the social dominance of Elamite in the period un-
der discussion.
The situation changed after the formation of the multinational Achaemenid Empire (late 6th 
century BCE), where Elamite was used in administration alongside several other languages, no-
tably Aramaic and Akkadian). Two administrative centres of the Achaemenid Empire, namely 
Susa and Persepolis, were situated on the former territory of Elam, but its rulers, at least begin-
ning with Darius I, had Iranian names and were presumably native speakers of Old Persian. This 
is also the period when the Old Persian language is put in writing: with one exception [Stolper, 
Tavernier 2007], its use is conﬁ ned to royal inscriptions, many of which also have Elamite ver-
sions.8 Interestingly enough, the senior scribes mentioned in the Elamite texts of this period have 
either Iranian or Semitic names, which suggests that Elamite literacy was maintained as homage 
to tradition, while Elamite ethnicity was no longer associated with high social status. The col-
lapse of the Achaemenid Empire put an end to writing Elamite, although Elamite names also 
appear in later sources [Stolper 2004: 64]. The main language that is now spoken on the former 
territory of Elam is Persian (Farsi).
It follows that ﬁ rstly, there was indeed a language shift from Elamite to Persian and, secondly, 
this was a gradual process that involved prolonged bilingualism and acculturation (cf. [Henkel-
man 2011: 584]). Under such conditions, one indeed expects to ﬁ nd some eﬀ ects of structural 
interference in Old Persian and perhaps on the subsequent stages of the Persian language, as per 
the scenario in Table 1 underscored by the bold script. These changes, however, were unlikely 
to lead to radical restructuring, of the kind typically observed in creole languages, but rather 
to the modiﬁ cation of certain structural features, just as is commonly assumed in the instance 
of prehistoric substrate-driven changes in Akkadian. One of such features could indeed be the 
grammaticalization of the Old Persian pronoun ha-ya- / ta-ya- as linker in the right-branching 
noun phrases. Crucially, the proposed scenario does not predict signiﬁ cant lexical interference 
 
8 The Bisitun monumental inscription of Darius I was composed in three languages, Elamite (2 versions), 
Babylonian, and Old Persian, but the spatial arrangement of this monument leaves no doubt that the ﬁ rst 
Elamite version of the inscription, not the Old Persian version, was its starting point. At the end of the 
Old Persian text one ﬁ nds the claim of Darius I that he commissioned it in the “Aryan”/ “Iranian” script, 
which had not been done before. While it is not the earliest case in human history when a new writing 
system was devised as a nationalistic alternative to the existing ones (Anatolian Hieroglyphs and Ug-
aritic Cuneiform arguably blaze the trail), it is probably the earliest explicit mention of such a practice 
in written records [Thomason 2001: 6].

from Elamite to Persian, nor is such empirically observed. Therefore, the actual domain of lan-
guage contact is well compatible with the independent conclusion that Old Persian constituted 
the target of language shift (cf. [Thomason 2001: 76]).
Turning to the empirical side of the problem, Elamite, like Persian, is an SOV language, while 
the Elamite noun phrase is characterized by right-branching [Stolper 2004: 84]. At a stage be-
fore the beginning of contacts between Elamite and Iranian, exempliﬁ ed by Middle Elamite (late 
second millennium BCE), the Elamite language had no structural cases, except in the pronom-
inal system [Stolper 2004: 74]. Class agreement represents the normative way of marking syn-
tactic relationship within a Middle Elamite noun phrase, a pattern that is frequently discussed 
in connection with the Bantu languages. The Elamite language distinguishes between the locu-
tive (ﬁ rst person), allocutive (second person), animate singular, animate plural, and inanimate 
noun classes [Stolper 2004: 73].
The paradigmatic alternation between class markers expresses contrast between both inﬂ ec-
tional and derivational forms, e.g. sunki-k ‘I, king’ / sunki-r ‘king’ / sunki-p ‘kings’ / sunki-me 
‘kingship’. Their syntagmatic function is arguably even more important, since the co-occurrence 
of class markers with identical functions ensures cohesion in a noun phrase, as illustrated by the 
examples below. In (16), the animate class marker -ri is attached to the ﬁ rst-person pronoun, in-
dicating its syntactic dependence (otherwise u- ‘I’ appears without a class marker but is capa-
ble of inducing the 1sg. agreement marker -k). In (17), an inanimate noun triggers an agreement 
marker -me on its syntactic dependents. Finally, in (18), one observes a more complex pattern 
of agreement: the pronoun u- carries both the animate marker -ri and the inanimate marker -me, 
referring back to ‘god’ and ‘temple’ respectively.

The contention of this paper is that the Old Persian construction *baga haya manā ‘my god’ 
(cf. (13) above), represents a calque of Middle Elamite nap(-ir) u-ri ‘my god’. It shares both 
the postposition of the syntactic dependent and the use of agreement marker with its Elamite 
counterpart. Furthermore, the Elamite construction with class agreement can be deployed for 
possessive, attributive, and appositional phrases [Stolper 2004: 74, 86], and the same is the ba-
sic scope of the Old Persian construction with haya- / taya- [Kent 1953: 85].9 The parallel is, 
of course, not fully precise: Old Persian agreement classes (three genders and two numbers) are 
diﬀ erent from those in Elamite, the relative pronoun haya- / taya- is placed between the head 
and the dependent, and most crucially, the recursive use of constructions with haya- / taya- does 
not seem to be attested in the published Old Persian texts. But in the absence of an abrupt lan-
guage shift, the target language tends to select the constructions that are already licensed by its 
structure for the implementation of the contact-induced changes. We have seen that the relative

sian syntax, uses the transcription hya- / tya- for what is now more commonly transcribed as haya- / 
taya-. Kent’s transcription is still occasionally used in modern scholarship, e.g. [Viti 2015: 320, fn. 203].

pronoun ya- was occasionally deployed as a linker in right-branching noun phrases in Old Aves-
tan (14)–(15). What functioned as an exceptional device in the language of Zarathustra, and 
arguably in Proto-Iranian, must have gained in frequency in Old Persian under the impact of the 
Elamite substrate.
An additional complication of the proposed hypothesis, which is perhaps responsible for 
the apparent lack of its explicit formulation in earlier literature, consists in further restructur-
ing of noun phrase morphosyntax in Achaemenid Elamite. The equivalent of kāra [haya ma]
nā ‘my army’ in the Elamite version of the Bisitun inscription is 1taššu-ip appa 1uni-na ‘troops 
that (are) mine’ [cf. Bae 2001: 123]. This is the word-by-word translation of the Persian turn 
of phrase: appa is the Elamite relative pronoun, while -na is the innovative genitive case end-
ing incorporating the historical relative particle -a [Stolper 2004: 74, 76]. In order to make sense 
of this construction and its numerous parallels in Achaemenid Elamite texts, one has to remem-
ber that the bulk of Achaemenid Elamite scribes, judging by their personal names, were Irani-
ans, not Elamites. Therefore, the restructuring of Achaemenid Elamite vis-à-vis the earlier stages 
of Elamite must reﬂ ect, above all, imperfect second language acquisition [Henkelman 2011: 
586–595].10 Even if some native Elamite scribes rubbed shoulders with their Iranian colleagues 
in the royal chancery, they probably had to learn the conventions of the scribal jargon. This is 
precisely a sociolinguistic setting where one can expect calques from the lingua franca of the 
scribes, which was presumably Old Persian or something very close. Special cases of reverse 
contact-induced developments in scribal milieus require a separate research paradigm and have 
to be studied apart from instances of language shift in oral communication, which is exempli-
ﬁ ed here by Elamite inﬂ uence on Old Persian.11
Although Elamite, under the proposed interpretation, represented the primary force in the 
restructuring of the Old Persian nominal system, the contacts between Persian and its west-
ern neighbors obviously did not stop at this point. We know that Aramaic dialects were spo-
ken in Mesopotamia in the Parthian and Sasanian periods (2nd century BCE through 7th cen-
tury CE), while the Arabic language ﬁ rmly established itself in Iraq and became politically 
and culturally dominant in Iran with the formation of the Arab Caliphate. In both Aramaic 
and Arabic, the possessors and attributes normally follow their syntactic heads, and it is very 
likely that Persian-Aramaic and Persian-Arabic bilingualism contributed to the proliferation 
of the right-branching noun phrases in Persian (cf. [Utas 2013]). What was a way of build-
ing deﬁ nite noun phrases in Old Persian, became the standard pattern in Middle Persian and 
practically the only option from Classical Persian onward. Yet interference from Aramaic and 
Arabic hardly helps to explain the origin of the ezāfe particle, while Elamite and Persian addi-
tionally share the SOV and Noun-Genitive word order pattern. Therefore, a gradual language 
shift from Elamite to Iranian in southwestern Iran must be regarded as the primary reason for 
the rise of the ezāfe construction.
 10 This claim is substantially diﬀ erent from the earlier hypothesis of [Gershevitch 1979], according 
to which Achaemenid Elamite represented a sort of rebus writing, to be always read in Old Persian. 
See [Tavernier 2008: 75–76] and [Kudrinski, Yakubovich 2016: 55–58] for the critique of Gershe-
vitch’s view.
 11 A research work summarizing all the instances of contact-induced developments in scribal milieus still 
remains a desideratum, but one case that received recently a thorough treatment is that of the Luwian 
inﬂ uence on New Hittite [Yakubovich 2010a]. Although one has compelling reasons to reconstruct 
a progressive shift from Hittite to Luwian in Hattusa and the surrounding area in the 13th century BCE, 
Hittite remained by tradition the primary written language of the cuneiform chancery. Numerous inter-
ference features observed in New Hittite bear witness to the imperfect acquisition of the Hittite written 
language by Luwian native speakers, just as the interference features of Neo-Elamite and Achaemenid 
Elamite texts ﬁ nd explanation in the imperfect acquisition of the Elamite written language by Iranian 
native speakers. Another parallel, namely Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit, is arguably less precise, since the 
original written transmission of the relevant texts is not self-evident. For a likely similar scenario con-

4. Urartian inﬂ uence?
A rather diﬀ erent picture emerges when one attempts to trace Urartian inﬂ uence in the north-
west of the Iranian-speaking area, which is invoked in [Windfuhr 2009: 28], alongside the 
Elamite inﬂ uence on Old Persian, as a factor in syntactic restructuring (see the beginning of Sec-
tion 3). Urartian, a language transparently related to Hurrian but lacking other close relatives, 
is attested in writing in the Kingdom of Van (Urartu) in 9th–7th centuries BCE. Urartian compo-
sitions almost exclusively belong to the public domain, royal inscriptions constituting the most 
widely attested genre. The territory of the Kingdom of Van in the early ﬁ rst millennium BCE 
roughly corresponds to the area where the Classical Armenian language was in use a millennium 
later. Scholars tend to agree that already in the period of Urartian literacy part of the population 
of the Kingdom of Urartu consisted of (Proto-)Armenian native speakers: at least, no hypoth-
eses of Armenian migrations postdating the collapse of the Urartian Kingdom are prominent 
in the current academic discourse.12 This suggests that when the Urartian language died out the 
bulk of Urartian speakers probably shifted to Armenian. Therefore, Armenian morphosyntax is 
the most obvious place to look for eﬀ ects of partial restructuring under the inﬂ uence of a hypo-
thetical Urartian substrate.
Such eﬀ ects, however, are not immediately obvious. The Classical Armenian language lacks 
rigid constraints on surface syntax, which enabled, for example, the translation of the Greek Bible 
into Armenian without syntactic permutations in most cases [Schmitt 2007: 158]. East Armenian, 
the group of dialects that was historically spoken in Iran and now underlies the oﬃ  cial language 
of the Republic of Armenia, has generalized the left-branching word order in the noun phrase. 
In this respect, it is similar to the bulk of the Iranian languages, but not to Persian or Kurdish. 
There could be several reasons why the Urartian speakers failed to leave a long-lasting imprint 
on the Armenian syntax, but one possible explanation is the modest size of the Urartian language 
community. This would also explain why Urartian literacy failed to spread to the private sphere 
and why we have no evidence for either oral or written transmission of the Urartian language 
in the Achaemenid period. Perhaps the collapse of the kingdom of Van triggered a quick assim-
ilation of the former Urartian elites to the numerically dominant Proto-Armenian population.
What has been said thus far does not bode well for the possibility of intensive Urartian-Ira-
nian bilingualism. Nevertheless, there is one instance where a group of Urartian noun phrases 
have apparently been calqued into Iranian. This is the chain of royal titles, typical of Ancient 
Near Eastern “Great Kings”. The titles in question ultimately go back to Mesopotamia, and some 
even ﬁ nd parallels in Egypt, but only the kings of Van and the Achaemenid rulers share their full 
set, albeit with minor variations (cf. [Schmitt 1977: 386–387, with further references]). Further-
more, the borrowing of Urartian titles in Iran appears to be plausible from the historical view-
point, given that the Kingdom of Van extended its territory to the south of Lake Urmia in the 8th 
century BCE and thus became relevant to the Iranian nomads in the area. It is likely, although 
not strictly provable, that the Urartian set of titles was ﬁ rst appropriated by the Median kings, 
the erstwhile lieges of Elam/Persia, and then appropriated by the Persian rulers when the bal-
ance of power in Iran shifted in their favor under Cyrus the Great. Needless to say, such a type 
of borrowing does not imply intensive language contact, merely a degree of mutual understanding 
among the elites. The parallelism between the Urartian and Achaemenid titles is illustrated below.

 12 I concur with the scenario of Proto-Armenian migrations from the west in the wake of the collapse 
of the Empire of Hattusa, as argued in [Diakonoﬀ  1968]. An alternative hypothesis, implying a much 
longer presence of Proto-Armenians in the Armenian Highlands, can be found in [Gamkrelidze, Ivanov 
1984: 890–894; 898–900]. There is limited evidence for Proto-Armenian function words borrowed into 
Urartian [Diakonoﬀ  1992; Yakubovich 2010b: 164].

‘I am Darius, Great King, King of Kings, King in Persia, King of Lands’ (DB. I: 1–2, 
[Schmitt 2009: 36–37]).
One can see that the morphosyntactic patterns of the titles ‘King of Kings’ and ‘King of (all) 
Lands’ display the same structure Noun-Genitive in both languages. Since the developed case 
system of Urartian also includes the genitive case, the rendering of the Urartian construction into 
Old Persian was straightforward, except for the unusual word order. What sets these titles apart 
from other right-branching noun phrases in Old Persian is the absence of the linker haya- / taya-. 
One possible explanation of this discrepancy is the immediate Median origin of the respective 
formulae [Kent 1953: 95]. The Median language, spoken in central Iran, presumably has not ex-
perienced intensive contacts with Elamite. Alternatively, one can hypothesize that the titles under 
discussion had been borrowed into Persian before the grammaticization of the kāra haya manā 
construction. Whatever their historical origin, they must have retained the ﬂ avor of acrolect ex-
pressions, similarly to the English titles heir apparent or envoy extraordinary.13
It is under the prism of this comparison that one should consider the origin of the ezāfe con-
struction in Kurdish and Zazaki, the Iranian languages that are now spoken on the former terri-
tory of the Kingdom of Van. As mentioned above in Section 1, a peculiarity of these languages 
(or many of their dialects) is that the ezāfe linker in right-branching noun phrases can still be in-
ﬂ ected for gender, number, and case, as was the situation in Old Persian. We shall illustrate this 
state of aﬀ airs with the case of Zazaki. Example (21) features the oblique masculine and plural 
linker -dē, which contrasts, for example, with direct masculine linker -ē, direct feminine linker 
-ā, and oblique feminine linker -dā [Paul 2009: 563]. Another peculiarity of the same language 
is the preservation of the oblique nominal maker -ī, which is presumably cognate with the Old 
Persian gen.sg. ending -ahyā. Yet another archaic feature of Zazaki is the ezāfe construction with 
head-noun ellipsis, as in (22).
(21) hētē   nē     ‘esker-ān-dē             pādīšāh-dē      bīn-īy-ā          rem-en-ā
to      these   soldier-���.��-���.���.��   king-���.���.�   other-���.�-����   run-���-3��.�
‘It runs to the soldiers of the other king’ [Paul 2009: 566].

‘This boy is not (the one) of Nahman Beg’ [Paul 2009: 567].
It is probably fair to say that the ezāfe construction in Zazaki exhibits more similarities 
to the kāra haya manā in Old Persian than the ezāfe construction in New Persian. At the same 
time, Zazaki, a north-western Iranian language, is no more closely related to Persian than, say, 
 13 A piece of independent evidence yielding further support to the Urartian origin of the construction un-
der discussion is the Old Persian phrase vašnā Ahuramadāha ‘by the will of Ahuramazda’, which fre-
quently occurs in the Bisitun inscription and also displays right-branching without a linker. It is pre-
sumably inspired by the Urartian expression ‘by the greatness/might of Haldi’, which frequently occurs 
in the Urartian royal annals but has no obvious counterpart in the Assyrian annalistic tradition [Klein 
1988: 393–394, fn. 12, with further references]. In this case, however, the hypothesis of transfer is argu-
ably more complex, because it requires the assumption of oral annalistic tradition in Iran as a source 
of inspiration for the Bisitun inscriptions.

Parthian or Balochi. One can, therefore, envisage three scenarios that can account for this typo-
logical similarity. Either it is purely fortuitous, or it arose in response to similar factors in dis-
tinct geographic regions, or the ancestors of Zazaki and Old Persian belonged to the same lin-
guistic area at some point in time.
The ﬁ rst scenario faces the typological problems that have already been addressed above. 
Zazaki, like Persian, is an SOV language, while the coexistence between SOV and head-depen-
dent word order in the noun phrase is cross-linguistically uncommon. The fact that the same 
rare correlation is shared by several genetically unrelated languages spoken roughly in the same 
region (e.g. Akkadian, Elamite, Urartian, and Persian) calls for an explanation in terms of lan-
guage contact. The second scenario, possibly implied in [Windfuhr 2009: 28], suggests that the 
ancestors of Kurdish and Zazaki experienced Urartian inﬂ uence at the northern end of the Zagros 
tier. Yet Urartian emerges as an unlikely substrate triggering the rise of the ezāfe construction, 
both because it probably had died out early and, more importantly, because no ezāfe construc-
tion emerged in the sole plausible case of an Urartian phrase calqued by Old Persian. Nor would 
such a process be likely on formal grounds, because the Urartian possessive constructions, un-
like their Elamite counterparts, lack morphemes that could be plausibly calqued as ezāfe linkers.
The obvious problem of the third scenario is the geographic distance between the regions 
where Zazaki is spoken now and where Old Persian was presumably spoken 2500 years ago. 
Zazaki, the westernmost Iranian language, is at home in central-eastern Turkey, while the Per-
sian heartland is the present-day Iranian province of Fars to the northeast of the Persian Gulf. 
Yet the gap of almost 2000 km between these two regions can be bridged: the Kurdish dialects, 
which occupy most of the interim space, share the ezāfe construction. Furthermore, it is likely 
on independent grounds that the Kurdish and Zazaki expansion to the northeast postdates the 
Achaemenid period. The sheer similarity of the Kurdish dialects implies the date of no earlier 
than the ﬁ rst millennium CE as the starting point of their ﬁ liation. The phonological innovations 
of the northern group of dialects (Kurmanji) suggest the distinct impact of the Armenian sub-
strate [Tsabolov 1997: 7–8], which tips scales in favour of localizing the Kurdish homeland in the 
south of the present-day Kurdish spread zone.14 The large number of phonological isoglosses 
shared by Persian and Kurdish, which set Kurdish apart from the other Northwest Iranian lan-
guages [Windfuhr 2009: 19–20], supports the same conclusion.15
As far as Zazaki is concerned, the analysis of its dialectal proﬁ le suggests that the speakers 
of this language were at home in northern Iran and their migrations to northern Mesopotamia and 
 14 It seems worth stressing once again that the question about the linguistic homeland of the Kurds should 
be treated separately from the politically charged issues of the origin of the ethnonym Kurd or the cra-
dle of Kurdish national identity. In particular, the inferences made here remain perfectly compatible 
with the observation that the expression “land of the Kurds” is applied to various areas of Upper Mes-
opotamia in its earliest attestations in Syriac sources. One should keep in mind that not all the varieties 
of Kurdish are mutually intelligible, and therefore, sociolinguistic matters aside, we are rather dealing 
with several languages belonging to the Kurdish linguistic area.
 15 Cf. the following formulation: “The fact that some of the innovations which have occurred in the vari-
ous stages of Persian have been taken over by Balochi (and some more by Kurdish) indicates that Ba-
lochi and Kurdish have been inﬂ uenced by Persian since Old Iranian times” [Korn 2003: 59]. At the 
same time, one of the anonymous reviewers informs me that the old areal isoglosses with Persian are 
more strongly felt in Northern Kurdish (Kurmanji) than in Central Kurdish dialects. Compare, for ex-
ample, Kurmanji čār ‘four’ vs. Central Kurdish čār, čuwār ‘id.’ [Tsabolov 2001–2010, I: 229] or Kur-
manji dil ‘heart’ vs. Central Kurdish dil, dir, zir ‘id.’ [Tsabolov 2001–2010, I: 307], where the Kur-
manji forms are close to Classical Persian čahār ‘four’ and dil ‘heart’ respectively. Since the Kurmanji 
speakers are rarely bilingual in Persian, whereas the speakers of Central Kurdish dialects frequently 
use Persian is their second language, this discrepancy does not ﬁ nd explanation in terms of recent con-
tacts with Persian. One can rather envisage the scenario of the Central Kurdish dialects amalgamating 
residual forms of Northwest Iranian vernaculars as a result of recent language shifts, but this question, 
of course, requires further study.

then Anatolia do not predate the Parthian period [Paul 1998]. There is hardly any doubt that the 
coexistence of the OV and N-Gen basic word order patterns in Zazaki shows the impact of lan-
guage contact. On the one hand, the languages of northern Iran, the homeland of Zazaki, typi-
cally exhibit consistent left-branching (cf. Section 1), on the other hand, vestiges of the origi-
nal left-branching nominal syntax are the Zazaki postpositions, such as bin ‘under’, ser ‘on(to)’ 
etc. [Paul 2009: 553]. Since the Kurdish language is recognized as the most important source 
of inﬂ uence on Zazaki [Paul 2009: 546], it is logical to attribute the new right-branching domi-
nant pattern of Zazaki nominal syntax to the Kurdish (Kurmanji) superstrate. The restructuring 
in certain North-Eastern Aramaic dialects, which yielded similar discrepancy between word or-
der patterns under Kurdish impact, supports the same conclusion, even though in this case the 
syntactic change primarily concerned object-verb placement [Haig 2015: 409–413].
Therefore, it seems reasonable to treat the spread of the ezāfe construction to the northwest, 
across the Zagros Mountains and the present-day borders of Iran, as a relatively recent phenome-
non, which accompanied the latest wave of Iranian westward migrations. Given that the Kurdish 
language is not attested in written sources up to the 16th century CE, while the Zazaki language 
came on the radar in the mid-19th century, the sociolinguistic details of this process will remain 
a matter of speculation. For example, one cannot be sure whether the speakers of Proto-Kurdish 
borrowed the construction under discussion from the Old Persian superstrate/adstrate or directly 
from the Elamite substrate. The last possibility, however, is by no means ruled out: even today 
the Iranian province of Ilam, situated immediately to the north of the former Elamite capital Susa, 
has a predominantly Kurdish population. Likewise, one cannot state with certainty, whether the 
Zaza migrations to the west through the Kurdish-speaking territory were accompanied by the shift 
of Kurdish speakers to Zazaki (Restructuring I) or stable bilingualism with Kurdish functioning 
as the acrolect (Restructuring II). But whichever scenario one favors, the right-branching ezāfe 
construction in Zazaki must ultimately be due to Kurdish inﬂ uence.
Summing up, despite the formal similarities between the syntax of Urartian and the Iranian 
languages spoken in the same area nowadays, the Urartian inﬂ uence on Kurdish or Zazaki can-
not be proven. Accordingly, there is no reason to treat Urartian as an Iranian substrate on a par 
with Elamite. Occam’s razor supports an alternative scenario of the recent spread of the ezāfe 
construction to the Armenian Highlands. A practical lesson to be learned from this discussion is 
the necessity to draw on both typological and historical expertise when tackling language con-
tact in ancient societies.
5. Special cases
The goal of this section is to address the data that represent potential challenges to the proposed 
scenario of language contact. There are several types of noun phrases that partially resemble the 
ezāfe construction but occur in several Old and Middle Iranian languages that never experienced di-
rect contact with Elamite. These are Bactrian appositional constructions, possessive noun phrases 
in Khwarezmian, and right-branching construction with the linker ya- in Younger Avestan. While 
the exhaustive description of these syntactic units cannot be attempted here, I intend to demon-
strate that the ﬁ rst two units are formally diﬀ erent from the ezāfe construction in Persian, while 
the situation in Younger Avestan probably reﬂ ects secondary restructuring under Persian inﬂ uence.
The Bactrian language of what is now northern Afghanistan lost its nominal case endings 
by the early ﬁ rst millennium CE. Therefore, the inherited preposition of syntactic dependents 
constitutes the main device of organizing Bactrian noun phrases, e.g. μασκο ναβιχτιγο οιγαλφανο 
‘above-written witnesses’, μο λαþνοβωστογο ‘this gift deed’, σασανο πορο ‘Sasan’s son’. A dif-
ferent construction is, however, deployed for expressing syntactic apposition, usually in com-
binations of names and titles. In this case, the most salient part of the phrase comes ﬁ rst, while 
the following elements are frequently, although not always, linked by the particle ι [Gholami 
106 
Voprosy Jazykoznanija 
2020. № 5
2011: 17]. Such examples, a representative selection of which is provided in Table 2, bear a de-
gree of resemblance to the ezāfe construction, e.g. Middle Persian Ardašīr ī Pābagān ‘Ardashir, 
son of Pabag’. In fact, Nicholas Sims-Williams, the decipherer of the Bactrian administrative 
texts, uses the term ezāfe with reference to this particle and tentatively connects it with the Ira-
nian relative pronoun *ya- [Sims-Williams 2007: 214b; 2009: 261]. The construction with the 
linker ι is, however, never used for the expression of possession in Bactrian [Gholami 2011: 17].

There is, furthermore, another group of cases, collected in Table 3 below, where Bactrian ι 
functions as an optional deﬁ nite article (a proclitic variant of the pronoun ειο ‘this’). In such 
cases, [Sims-Williams 2007: 214b] admits the connection of ι with the Iranian proximal demon-
strative pronoun *ayam, which is also accepted in [Gholami 2011: 11]. Given the formal possi-
bility of such an etymology, it seems equally plausible that *ayam also represents an archetype 
of the linker ι in Table 2. There are many languages, including English, where the deﬁ nite arti-
cle can function as linker in the appositional construction, e.g. Richard the Lionheart, Jude the 
Obscure. If one accepts a similar semantic extension for Bactrian, then the parallelism between 
the expression of apposition in Bactrian and Persian turns out to be a mere coincidence. Alter-
natively, given that Bactria belonged to the Sasanian Empire in the 3rd century CE, one cannot 
exclude contact-driven convergence with the Middle Persian onomastic formulae.

A complication of the proposed analysis is the presence of the rare feminine form ια ‘this’. 
On face value, it supports the contamination with the relative pronoun, since the feminine coun-
terpart of Iranian *ayam ‘this’ was *iyam, which could not yield ια in Bactrian through a regu-
lar sound change. Yet one cannot exclude the early analogical replacement of *iyam with *ayā 
or *iyā (cf. the discussion of Khwarezmian below). Even if *yā, nom.sg.f of *ya-, represented 
an additional source of analogy, there is no gain in restricting its scope to the secondary ap-
positional construction. To be sure, the Bactrian language partook in the functional extension 
of the interrogative pronoun *ka- / či- at the expense of the old relatives, in accordance with the 
common pattern of Middle Iranian. But the relative pronoun *ya- clearly existed in the ances-
tor of the Bactrian language at some point, and could accordingly inﬂ uence the paradigm of the 
proximal demonstrative.
This having been said, there remains a formal possibility that the Bactrian appositional con-
struction had generalized the relative pronoun *ya- before it merged with the demonstrative 
pronoun *ayam. Even under such an assumption, there is no reason to treat the Bactrian mor-
phosyntactic change as a close parallel to the rise of the ezāfe construction in Persian. Cru-
cially, the Bactrian development did not involve a change in the direction of branching. Al-
ready in Old Iranian, the epithets and other appositions tended to follow the elements they 
modify, e.g. Y. 29.8 Zaraϑuštrō Spitāmo ‘Zarathushtra Spitama’, Y. 32.3 yūš daēuuā vīspā̊ ŋhō 
‘you, demons of all kinds’ (nom.) [West 2011: 10–11]. A linker could occasionally be inserted 
to reinforce this construction, e.g. Y. 32.5 vā̊  … yə̄ ṇg daēuuə̄ ṇg ‘you, who (are) demons’ (acc.). 
In essence, the head / dependent assignment in appositional constructions is the matter of prag-
matics rather than grammar, and therefore the word order in such phrases can hardly be seen 
as typologically informative.
Now we can move to the situation in Khwarezmian, an Iranian language that was spoken im-
mediately to the south of the Aral Sea up to the Early Islamic period. The Khwarezmian deﬁ -
nite article, ī in the masculine and yā in the feminine, was not declined for case. According 
to [Durkin-Meisterernst 2009: 343], it “patently originates in the Old Iranian relative pronoun”, 
but such a functional development is typologically quite uncommon. As one option, one can 
treat the Khwarezmian article as a result of contamination between the demonstrative pronoun 
*iyam and the relative pronoun *ya- (nom.sg.f yā). This is essentially the same solution that was 
discussed above in connection with Bactrian. Alternatively, one can assume that the demonstra-
tive pronoun *ayam built the secondary form *ayā (or *iyā) through leveling to *tā ‘that (nom.
sg.f)’ and perhaps to the feminine adjectives in *-ā. Both of these possibilities have already been 
addressed in [Edel’man 2008: 30–31].
What makes the situation in Khwarezmian distinct from Bactrian is the innovative right-branch-
ing word order, which extends itself to all sorts of noun phrases, not just to the appositions. In the 
instance of the nominal and adjectival constituents, both the head and its right-branching depen-
dent are accompanied by the article. The postposed adjective always takes the article of the head 
noun, while the article of the postposed genitive agrees with it in gender, as in (23). The posses-
sive forms in /-ān/ display the syntactic behavior of adjectives rather than genitives. Thus, in the 
instance of (24–25), the gender of the noun w’c ‘matter’ is irrelevant for the formation of the 
possessive construction, since the article that precedes it merely duplicates that of the head noun. 
All the examples below are taken from [Durkin-Meisterernst 2009: 358].16
(23) ’y        b’r           y’        ’wdry
���.��.�   load.���.��   ���.��.�   belly.���.��(�)
‘the load of the belly (= foetus)’
 16 It is worth noting in passing that the morpheme /-ān/, present in w’c-’n and traditionally analyzed 
as a possessive case marker, may well go back to the adjectival suﬃ  x *-āna [Edel’man 2008: 28]. If so, 
it is the same morpheme that yielded the marker of Middle Persian and Bactrian patronymics. For the 
occurrence of Bactrian patronymics as second members of the appositional construction, cf. Table 2 
above.

Examples (24)–(25) and the like may appear akin to the Persian ezāfe construction, and 
were indeed treated as suggestive evidence for the contamination between the demonstra-
tive and relative pronouns yielding the Khwarezmian article [Edel’man 2008: 31, with fur-
ther references]. Such a reconstruction is certainly possible, but this is not the only possibil-
ity. Another crucial innovation of the Khwarezmian language is the rise of the verb-initial 
word order [Ibid.: 54–57], which was accompanied by the head marking of the nominal ar-
guments with the help of clitic pronouns, also known as clitic doubling (for the relevant ex-
amples see [Durkin-Meisterernst 2009: 360–361]). This phenomenon, quite unusual as it 
is for the Iranian languages, provides nonetheless a perfect correlation for the noun phrase 
word order in (23)–(25): the VSO / VOS patterns and the head-dependent order in the noun 
phrase are both typical manifestations of right-branching. Whether or not the ongoing rad-
ical inversion of word order in Khwarezmian was substrate-induced remains an open ques-
tion, but even if it was, this putative substrate has nothing to do with Elamite, which is char-
acterized by verb-ﬁ nal syntax.
Neither is there any necessity to treat the repetition of articles, deployed as a linking device 
in (24)–(25), as a close genetic or areal match of the kāra haya manā construction in Old Per-
sian. If anything, both types of noun phrases reﬂ ect a cross-linguistic tendency toward the rise 
of morphosyntactic complexity in the transition from left to right-branching (cf. e.g. English the 
enemy lines vs. the lines of the enemies). A closer parallel to (24)–(25) would be the phrase οἱ 
ἄνδρες οἱ ἀγαθοί ‘good men’, which was available in Attic Greek as a secondary and formally 
more complex alternative to οἱ ἀγαθοὶ ἄνδρες ‘id.’ In a sense, both the Greek and Khwarezmian 
right-branching constructions may be regarded as instances of mismatch between the attribu-
tive / possessive semantics and appositional syntax. A test that conﬁ rms such an interpretation 
for Khwarezmian is the possibility to repeat prepositions in the situation of right-branching: f-y 
zβ’k f-y trk’nk ‘in the tongue of the Turks’ [Durkin-Meisterernst 2009: 358]. Thus, although con-
tamination with the relatives remains theoretically possible, the derivation of articles from de-
monstrative pronouns appears to be fully suﬃ  cient for a typologically informed account of the 
Khwarezmian noun phrases under discussion.
The case of Younger Avestan is quite diﬀ erent. Here one encounters numerous noun phrases 
where syntactic dependents are assuredly linked to their heads by means of relative pronouns 
or particles, which is the exact archetype of the Persian ezāfe construction. A typical example 
is a passage from the ritualistic part of the Avesta known as the Vidēvdād: daēnąm yąm āhūirīm 
zaraϑuštrīm ‘the religion of Ahura and Zarathushtra (acc.)’ (Vd. 2.1). Yet the paradigm of the 
linker is irregular in an interesting way. To begin with a minimal pair, in Vd. 2.1 we encounter 
a contrast between the nominative and dative appositional constructions tūm yō ahurō mazdā̊  
‘thou, Ahura Mazda (nom.)’ and mana yat̰ zaraϑuštrāi ‘to me, Zarathushtra (dat.)’. In the ﬁ rst 
case, the regular nom.sg.m form of the relative pronoun is in use, in the second one the relative 
pronoun is replaced with the particle yat̰, historically a form of nom.-acc.sg.n.
In general, nominative, accusative, and instrumental forms of the relative pronoun in the 
linking function are mostly preserved, while the other case forms disappear in favor of yat̰ 
in Younger Avestan [Haider, Zwanziger 1984: 149 with further references]. This mismatch can 
be additionally illustrated by the ablative phrase Yt. 17.19 haca zəmat̰ yat̰ paϑanaiiā̊  ‘from the 
broad Earth’, the locative phrase Vd. 5.39 ahmi aŋhuuō yat̰ astuuaiṇti ‘in this material exis-
tence’ or the genitive phrase Vd. 3.15. aētahe narš … yat̰ iristō.kaṣ̌ahe ‘of that man (who is) 
an undertaker’. It is compatible with the hypothesis that the ezāfe construction in Younger 
 
 Ilya S. Yakubovich 
109
Avestan represents an attempt to copy a similar construction from another language, featuring 
a more restricted paradigm of grammatical cases. A possible reason for the preservation of the 
declined linkers in the accusative and instrumental phrases is the presence of the Old Avestan 
prototypes for the relevant constructions, cf. (14) and (15) above. If this is a viable explana-
tion, the contact-induced construction was selected in the course of second-language acquisi-
tion of Avestan, precisely for those instances where the Old Avestan corpus failed to provide 
a ready-made pattern.17
The obvious candidate for the trigger of this process is Persian, the language (or rather suc-
cession of languages) that was particularly likely to aﬀ ect the transmission of the Avesta from 
the sociolinguistic perspective. Already in the Achaemenid Empire, the magi-priests, described 
by Herodotus (1.140) as devout Zoroastrian practitioners, were integrated into the administra-
tion of the state cult [Dandamaev 2012]. In the Sasanian period, Zoroastrianism became the state 
religion of Iran, and the ﬁ rst written ﬁ xation of the Avesta was presumably accomplished under 
the patronage of the Sasanian rulers.
One must, however, keep in mind that the Old Persian language of royal inscriptions re-
stricts the kāra haya manā construction to the nominative, genitive and ablative-instrumen-
tal cases (cf. Section 2). This begs the question about the variety of Persian that could impact 
the spread of the the ezāfe construction to other cases in Younger Avestan. In my opinion, 
this was the lingua franca on the Achaemenid provincial elites, which can be called for con-
venience Peripheral Old Persian, and which anticipated the evolution of Late Old Persian, 
as described in [Schmitt 1999: 59–118]. The drastic simpliﬁ cation of Persian morphology 
over some two centuries of the existence of the Achaemenid Empire can be best accounted 
for by assuming the massive shift to Persian on the part of its subjects, inevitably accompa-
nied by imperfect learning. The nominal declension of Peripheral and Late Old Persian was 
presumably reduced to the opposition between the direct and oblique cases, with no gender 
distinctions. In contrast, the ezāfe linker, which lacked the inherited genitive-dative form, may 
have been reduced to a single particle, which could then easily spread across the board.18 The 
learners of Younger Avestan would accordingly extend their ezāfe construction to all types 
of noun phrases but use the inherited form yat̰  as the equivalent of the Persian ezāfe parti-
cle in secondary constructions.
Another approach to investigating the ezāfe construction in Younger Avestan is the study 
of metric irregularities. Certain liturgical parts of the Avesta are written in eight-syllable lines, 
which resemble the basic units of the Sanskrit ślokas and therefore may well reﬂ ect Indo-Ira-
nian heritage. While the Younger Avestan meter notoriously features many exceptions from this 
basic rule, some of the surface irregularities may be eliminated by way of restoring the original 
text, unaﬀ ected by the corruptions of the subsequent oral or written transmission. Below, such 
an experiment is applied to the passage Y 10.1 from a hymn to Haoma (cf. [Kellens 2003] and 
[Pirart 2004] for its philological treatment and translation). One can see in the last two lines that 
part of the price for obtaining a regular metric structure is assuming a secondary origin of the 
ezāfe-like particles.
 17 An alternative account, oﬀ ered in [Reichelt 1909: 370], explains this distribution in syllabic terms: the 
monosyllabic forms of the relative pronoun were preserved in the linker function, while the disyllabic 
forms were replaced with the particle. Such an analysis is certainly possible but not mutually exclu-
sive with the one proposed here: the constraint on monosyllabic linkers may have been the fact of Old 
Avestan, where linkers were generally fairly rare. After they gained in frequency, the ezāfe construc-
tion was generalized to all the cases with the help of the new particle, but this already happened within 
the context of liturgical language acquisition.
 18 A testimony to the innovative ezāfe particle t-y in Late Old Persian is A2Sc. 5-6 i-m-a-m [u-s-t-]c-n-
a-m t-y a-θ-g-i-n-a-m ‘this stone staircase’ [Schmitt 2009: 194], where t-y is used instead of the ex-
pected t-y-a-m. This example was most recently compared with the Younger Avestan ezāfe construc-
tion in [Meyer 2017: 216].

What justiﬁ es the observations and experiments of the type outlined above is the presumable 
transmission of Avestan in a multilingual or non-native environment for a long period of time. 
The Avestan texts are limited to Zoroastrian religious literature. The earliest of them, written 
in Old Avestan, reﬂ ect the native language of the founders of the new religion, arguably includ-
ing the prophet Zarathushtra. At that time, the language must have been fairly close to common 
Iranian, since it displays no genetic innovations characterizing West Iranian and no undisputa-
ble areal innovations that are associated with East Iranian.19 The other Avestan texts either arose 
within the fold of Zoroastrian tradition or represent the adaptation of pre-existing Iranian texts 
to this tradition. While the Avestan language may have lingered on as a vernacular for some pe-
riod of time, it has no modern direct descendants. The conservative account of [de Vaan 2003: 
14] suggests the approximate date of 300 BCE for the extinction of Avestan as a living language, 
while the most commonly held date for the written ﬁ xation of the Avesta is some six to eight 
hundred years later [Hoﬀ mann, Forssman 2004: 36].
The Persian inﬂ uence on Avestan triggering the spread of the ezāfe construction may have 
taken various forms. Since the majority of the scholars assume that the compilation of the Vidē-
vdād dates back to the post-Achaemenid period [Malandra 2006], the whole composition may 
have come into being in the bilingual circles of the magi-priests. If so, the right-branching noun 
phrases with the linker ya- in the Vidēvdād and several other late compositions may be sum-
marily treated as calques of the kāra haya manā construction in Old Persian or rather its im-
mediate descendant.20 In sociolinguistic terms, such restructuring in a non-natively transmitted 
language resembles the development of Achaemenid Elamite, except for the original oral trans-
mission of the Vidēvdād. In the instance of several Avestan hymns to Zoroastrian deities, the 
pre-Achaemenid date of the respective compositions appears more likely. Nevertheless, linkers 
could still be secondarily inserted in the process of their subsequent transmission, even at the 
expense of corrupting their metric structure, as in the example in Table 4. The absence of similar 
 19 For East Iranian as a linguistic area rather than a genetic branch of the Iranian languages, see [Sims-Wil-
liams 1989: 165]. In terms of linguistic geography, the contrast between the status of East and West Ira-
nian correlates with the assumption that the speakers of the East Iranian languages stayed in and around 
the area of the postulated Central Asian homeland of the Iranians, whereas the West Iranian speakers 
migrated farther westward to the Iranian Plateau.
 20 The possible impact of non-native transmission on the morphosyntax of Younger Avestan rarely attracts 
scholarly attention, perhaps because the majority of scholars working on the Avestan grammar were 
trained as Indo-Europeanists rather than sociolinguists. While the comprehensive description of the rel-
evant Younger Avestan innovations clearly falls beyond the scope of this paper, an additional morpho-
syntactic phenomenon that is unlikely to have come into being within a community of native speakers 
is the secondary use of instrumental plural forms for Younger Avestan subjects and objects, most re-
cently studied in [de Vaan 2018]. The smoking gun in this case is the possible lack of morphological 
agreement in a noun phrase, e.g. Y 15.1 vaŋhūš srīrāiš nāmąn ‘good beautiful names’, where only the 
second word has the instrumental ending. Presumably such hypercorrections occurred as a reaction 
to a vernacular where dedicated instrumental plural forms were no longer in use.

insertions in Old Avestan texts has to do with their particularly sacred character within the tra-
dition: their ﬁ nal shape was ﬁ xed earlier and transmitted rather more carefully.21
To be sure, even if one strips the Younger Avestan corpus of all the Achaemenid and post-Ach-
aemenid additions and secondary insertions, one will wind up with the residue of right-branching 
constructions with pronominal linkers in Younger Avestan, for which the explanation in terms 
of language contact does not impose itself. The quantiﬁ cation of this phenomenon must remain 
a task for the future, but in notional terms it can be compared with the situation in Parthian and 
particularly Old Avestan, where such constructions existed but played a subordinate role. The re-
stricted use of verbless relative clauses modiﬁ ed by case attraction, the ancestors of the later 
ezāfe construction, can be arguably reconstructed for common Iranian (cf. Section 2). In con-
trast, the generalization of such a construction as the primary or one of primary means of orga-
nizing the noun phrase is restricted to a fairly speciﬁ c set of Iranian languages. These are lan-
guages where one can assume the presence of the Elamite substrate, such as Old Persian and 
perhaps the ancestor of Kurdish, modern descendants of such languages, such as Farsi or Tajik, 
and languages aﬀ ected by secondary contact-induced restructuring, such as Zazaki or Younger 
Avestan. The rest of the Iranian languages lack the construction under discussion, while its as-
sumed manifestations in Bactrian and Khwarezmian receive alternative explanations.

 21 The secondary insertions corrupting the metric structure of Old Avestan texts are also well known [Gip-
pert 2000: 166–167]. In this case, however, one is dealing not with direct interference eﬀ ects but rather 
with exegetic annotation.
