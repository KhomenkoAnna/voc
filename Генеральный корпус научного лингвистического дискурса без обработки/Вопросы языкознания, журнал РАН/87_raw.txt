1. Introduction. Due to her untimely death in 2007, Tanya Reinhart never completed the 
planned Linguistic Inquiry volume on the Theta System (TS), which is regarded by some as “one 
of her major contributions to linguistic theory” (p. xi). The planned volume was supposed to pro-
vide a comprehensive text containing a systematic exposition of TS, reﬂecting its subsequent de-
velopment by Reinhart and her collaborators since the publication of her ﬁrst two expository ar-
ticles on TS in 2000 and 2002. The aim of the book under review, edited by linguists at Utrecht 
institute of Linguistics OTS (UiL OTS), with whom she actively collaborated for the last 15 years 
of her life, is to provide such a comprehensive text.
Chapter I, the core of the book, is an extended and annotated version of Reinhart’s “foun-
dational” article “The Theta System: Syntactic realization of verbal concepts,” supplemented 
by a summary of [Reinhart 2002] by the editors. Although the article was previously published 
as [Reinhart 2000] in UiL OTS Working Papers in Linguistics, the editors decided that, due to its 
seminal status, it deserves to be more widely accessible. The chapter also contains a short note 
by Reinhart’s former graduate student and now an assistant professor at UiL OTS Marijana Marelj, 
which discusses implications of TS to Case Theory and is based on the LSA course co-taught 
by Reinhart and Marelj in 2005.
Chapter II, “The Thematic Phase and the architecture of grammar” by Reinhart’s former col-
leagues at Tel Aviv University Julia Horvath and Tal Siloni, is arguably the most interesting contribu-
tion in this volume for a general linguistic audience already familiar with TS. The chapter discusses 
differences between TS and the so-called “syntacticocentric” approaches to argument structure es-
poused by Hagit Borer [2005] and Gillian Ramchand [2008] among others. The chapter provides 
evidence against such approaches and in favor of the active lexicon approach favored by TS.
Finally, Chapter III, “Clitics and reﬂexives: Reducing the lexicon-syntax parameter,” by Mari-
jana Marelj and Eric Reuland, does not address TS directly but is concerned with the status of the 
Lex(icon)-Syn(tax) parameter [Reinhart, Siloni 2005], developed within TS and aimed at explain-
ing cross-linguistic variation in reﬂexivization and other thematic arity operations. The article 
is part of a larger project of revising Chomsky’s [1981] canonical Binding Theory, led over the 
years by Reuland and his co-authors, including Reinhart herself (e. g. [Reinhart, Reuland 1993; 
Reuland 2011]). In their contribution, Marelj and Reuland attempt to reduce the Lex-Syn param-
eter to independent principles of grammar (in accordance with the current minimalist assump-
tions) while supporting the core theoretical insight of TS, i. e. the existence of lexical operations.
After a brief introduction of TS (Section 2), I will critically examine the following three ques-
tions, which roughly correspond to the three chapters of the volume:
 
— What is the empirical motivation for TS (Section 3)?

— What are the advantages of TS over syntacticocentric approaches to argument structure 
(Section 4)?
 
— How can TS and the results obtained within TS be integrated into the current grammat-
ical theory (Section 5)?
2. TS in a Nutshell. The main question TS is concerned with is what kind of information 
pertaining to the conceptual structure of verbs is legible to the computational system (syntax). 
To address this question, TS proposes a way of encoding verbal concepts in the form of particular 
combinations of feature clusters (related to each other by arity operations) as well as the inter-
face between the system of concepts and syntactic structure in the form of mapping/linking in-
structions. Thus, TS can be viewed as a kind of channel through which conceptual information is 
passed down to the syntax. In this way, TS crucially differs from “syntacticocentric” approaches, 
where conceptual information (often referred to as “encyclopedic information”) is either totally 
inaccessible to the syntax (as in Borer’s [2005] approach) or accessible only in the form of a small 
inventory of c-selectional features (as in Ramchand’s [2008] approach). Under both approaches, 
thematic information is encoded directly by the syntactic structure (hence “syntacticocentric”), 
rendering the lexicon superﬂuous as a separate module of representing conceptual information.
Perhaps the most recognizable feature of TS is the decomposition of traditional semantic roles 
into clusters of two binary features [±c] for causal responsibility and [±m] for (obligatory) mental 
involvement in the event / state, giving rise to eight possible combinations, as in the Table below.

Such decomposition allows to deﬁne classes of theta-roles (akin to classes of phonemes) and 
thereby (i) capture generalizations about mapping/linking (see (1)), as well as (ii) give a precise 
formulation of thematic arity operations such as Expletivization (external role reduction), Bundling 
(reﬂexivization), Causativization, etc. (see Section 3). In addition, TS provides an instruction for 
marking the concept with the ���(usative) feature (cf. Burzio’s generalization).

Merging instructions
 
a. The class of [+] clusters is merged externally.
 
b. The class of [–] clusters is merged internally.2
 
c. When nothing rules it out, merge externally.

2 Theme unergatives like glow present an exception to (1b), which led Reinhart to restrict the rules in (1) 
to concepts with n > 1 clusters. See, though, [Potashnik 2012] for an alternative analysis of these verbs.

Accusative marking
If the lexical entry includes a [+c] cluster and a fully-speciﬁed cluster [−c±m] (i. e. [–c+m] 
or [–c–m]), it is marked with the ��� feature.
We now turn to empirical arguments advanced by Reinhart in favor of TS.
3. Empirical motivation for TS. Reinhart’s article in Chapter I presents two main arguments 
for TS, which come from the Unaccusative puzzle and Experiencer alternations.
The Unaccusative puzzle consists of two questions: (i) how can the grammar and the child 
learning the grammar “know” which verbs have unaccusative syntax (i. e. that their sole argument 
is internal); (ii) why do unaccusative verbs often share morphology with reﬂexive verbs, cf. Stakan 
razbilsja ‘the glass broke’ and Ivan pomylsja ‘Ivan washed.’ Building on the observation that most 
unaccusative verbs have transitive counterparts allowing for both animate and inanimate causers 
(cf. Max / The storm / The stone broke the window), Reinhart argues that a verb is unaccusative iff 
(i) its verbal concept includes a [+c] role, and (ii) this role is reduced (by Expletivization—external 
role reduction). Transitive counterparts of unaccusative verbs are thus contrasted with “true” caus-
ative verbs like walk, derived from the separate Causativization operation, which adds a [+c+m] 
(mentally involved) argument (cf. Max / *Hunger walked the dog) to the original entry. By giving 
a formal, feature-based deﬁnition of unaccusativity in contrast to purely semantic approaches like 
that of [Levin, Rappaport Hovav 1995], Reinhart is able to correctly classify “semantic exceptions,” 
namely “Theme unergatives” like glow (which do not seem to have transitive counterparts, but see 
[Potashnik 2012]) and “internally-caused” verbs like arrive and happen (which do have transitive 
counterparts in some languages). Given that unaccusative verbs are derived by a role-reducing op-
eration, i. e. Expletivization, Reinhart is able to capture their morphological similarity with reﬂex-
ive verbs, derived by the Bundling operation (which also reduces the internal role).
Experiencer alternations (e. g. The doctor’s letter worries her vs. She worries about her 
health) are puzzling because: (i) intransitive alternants are unergatives despite their morphologi-
cal similarity to unaccusatives (cf. udivit’sja ‘become surprised’ and slomat’sja ‘become broken’); 
(ii) subjects of transitive alternants have “unaccusative” properties (allow backwards anaphora 
as in Heri health worries every patienti) despite being externally-merged as Causes [Pesetsky 
1995]; (iii) simultaneous realization of Cause ([+c]) and Subject Matter ([–m]) roles is disallowed 
(Pesetsky’s [1995] T/SM restriction), cf. *[The doctor’s letter] worried Lucy [PP about her health], 
see (5). Reinhart argues that both transitive and intransitive alternants correspond to the under-
lying three-place concept ([+c], [–c+m], [–m]). Intransitive alternants are derived by the Exple-
tivization operation reducing the [+c] role (hence morphological similarity to unaccusatives), but 
their remaining cluster is mixed ([–c+m]) and thus, by (1c), is external. The T/SM restriction is 
derived from (i) the assumption that clusters having a construal under which they are identical are 
non-distinct (thus [+c] and [–m] in (5) are non-distinct as they both can be construed as [+c–m]), 
and (ii) a ban on the co-occurrence of non-distinct clusters.3 Because of this semantic similarity 
the transitive subject can be construed not only as [+c] but also as [–m] and thus merged inter-
nally, accounting for the backwards anaphora pattern.
In addition to Reinhart’s arguments, Marelj’s contribution (extending Reinhart’s article) presents 
evidence in favor of the accusative marking principle in (2). Marelj argues that it captures the failure 
of PP-selecting verbs such as worry (about) and wonder (about) to assign accusative case — a be-
havior unexpected under Burzio’s generalization, which assumes that the presence of an external 
argument is sufﬁcient for accusative-assignment. Marelj observes that the PP-argument of these 
verbs is compatible with (but does not require) a Cause interpretation, as in The question made 
John wonder (cf. *The question made John ask), and hence should correspond to the [–m] clus-
ter, unspeciﬁed for the [±c] feature. Therefore, by (2), it cannot ���-mark the verb. This allows 
Marelj to derive the case-related distinction between ask and wonder assumed by Pesetsky [1982].
 
3 The notion of non-distinctness here follows Marelj’s [2004] reinterpretation of Reinhart’s original deﬁ-
nition.

While Reinhart’s analysis of unaccusative and Experiencer verbs is convincing, the ���-mark-
ing principle in (2) and the account of the T/SM restriction are not unproblematic. The problem 
with (2) is that it is too strong. First, contra (2), accusative can be assigned by verbs that lack [+] 
clusters — a problem inherited by (2) from Burzio’s generalization — as in Russian MenjaACC tošnit 
‘I feel nauseated’ and English It struck me that I should have used “Elmer” in this sentence (see 
[Marantz 2000]). Second, contra (2), accusative can be assigned not only to Theme ([–c–m]) or Ex-
periencer ([–c+m]) arguments but also to Goals ([–c]) and Instruments ([+c–m]), as shown in (3).
(3) 
a. John[+c+m] gave Mary[–c] a book[–c–m].
 
b. John[+c+m] shot the bullet[–c–m] / the victim[–c] / the gun[+c–m]. 
[Potashnik 2012]
One may object that this is not a “true” accusative but an underlying dative / oblique disguised 
as accusative, as proposed in [Potashnik 2012] and [Botwinik 2013], and thus is not subject to (2). 
However, if “surface accusative” is not regulated by TS, Marelj’s account of the difference be-
tween ask and wonder is lost, as nothing precludes the [–m] cluster of wonder to be assigned 
“surface accusative” (unless one provides an independent account of the difference between “sur-
face” vs. “deep accusative”).4
Reinhart’s account of the T/SM restriction in terms of non-distinctness is also too strong. First, 
it incorrectly rules out the co-occurrence of [–c] and [–m] (which are non-distinct under Reinhart’s 
deﬁnition), cf. Pesetsky’s [1995] example Sue is angry with Bill[–c] about the party[–m].5 Second, 
it fails to account for the contrast in (4) (due to [Hartman 2008]), similar to the T/SM restriction. 
It is not the co-occurrence of [+c] and [–m] per se that causes ungrammaticality in (4a), cf. the 
grammatical (4b), but that of the three clusters ([+c], [–m] and [–c+m]) simultaneously, cf. (5).6
(4) 
a. *The bridge[+c] dwarfed Mary[–c+m] the lighthouse[–m].
 
b. The mansion[+c] dwarfs the house next door[–m].
(5) 
*The doctor’s letter[+c] worried Lucy[–c+m] about her health[–m].
Having presented empirical arguments for TS, we turn to more conceptual issues relating to the 
difference between TS and alternative approaches to argument structure.
4. Comparison between TS and syntacticocentric approaches. The main claim of Chap-
ter II by Horvath and Siloni is that syntacticocentric approaches to argument structure such as that 
of Borer [2005] and Ramchand [2008] came to dominate over active lexicon approaches such 
as TS not because of their intrinsic value but due to the fact they ﬁt better with other inﬂuential 
proposals (e. g. Larsonian [1988] VP-shell, Chomsky’s [1995] little v / Kratzer’s [1996] Voice, se-
mantic decomposition of verb meanings into abstract predicates such as ����� and ������ [Dowty 
1979], Baker’s [1988] Uniformity of Theta-Assignment Hypothesis and Distributed Morphology 
[Marantz 1997]). The aim of Horvath and Siloni is threefold: (i) to reexamine evidence for syn-
tactic decomposition / syntacticocentric approaches, which Horvath and Siloni believe is sparse, 
(ii) to propose an alternative for articulated VP to handle three-argument verbs, and (iii) to pres-
ent evidence for active lexicon approaches.
 
4 Note that “deep accusative” cannot be identiﬁed by standard structural Accusative diagnostics as shown by the 
passivization of verbs with [–c] / [+c–m] arguments, as in The victim was shot and Mary was given a book, cf. (3).
 
5 See [Knyazev 2013] for some further problems with this constraint.
 
6 Knyazev [2016] argues that the T/SM restriction in Russian (cf. the Russian counterpart of (5) *Pis’mo 
doktora bespokoit Ljusi o ee zdorov’e) stems from the realization of the same theta-role twice. This is sug-
gested by the fact that the subject of object Experiencer verbs like bespokoit’ ‘worry’ and pugat’ ‘frighten’ 
is not a Cause but a Subject Matter (contra [Pesetsky 1995]). This is shown by the infelicity of examples 
like #Tabletka pugaet / bespokoit Ivana ‘#The pill worries / frightens John’ in a sci-ﬁ context where a fear / 
worry-inducing drug affects Ivan unbeknownst to him.

Horvath and Siloni start with calling into question evidence for syntactic decomposition ap-
proaches from the ambiguity of again (e. g. [von Stechow 1996]) and other adverbials, showing 
that such ambiguity is not as pervasive as these approaches suggest (by freely providing differ-
ent structural positions for such adverbials), cf. the lack of the restitutive interpretation in #John 
cleaned the jacket again (‘the jacket became clean again without John having cleaned it before’) 
and the lack of the result state modiﬁcation in #I dried the towels for a few days (‘the towels were 
dry for a few days’). Horvath and Siloni also argue against approaches introducing external argu-
ments by a separate head (little v / Voice) (i) by providing examples where a verb imposes selec-
tional restrictions on its external argument (cf. The bees / *The snake stung John), which are hard 
to capture in such approaches, and (ii) by questioning the standard “special meanings” arguments 
for such approaches (e. g. [Marantz 1984]). Horvath and Siloni suggest that special meanings 
for external but not internal arguments, i. e. the fact that the interpretation of the object in John 
killed a bottle inﬂuences that of the subject (cf. John killed a cockroach) but not vice versa, are 
due to the conventionalization of interpretive units (= constituents), which include [V-O] but not 
[S-V], rather than from the separation of the external argument from the VP. The same applies 
to the argument from the non-existence of S-V idioms. Horvath and Siloni also correctly predict 
that special meanings are in fact possible with external arguments of unergative verbs (The en-
gine ran, His nose ran, etc.), which is unexpected under the “little v” approach.
In order to handle three-argument verbs and IO-DO asymmetries (see [Larson 1988]) in a system 
without articulated VP, Horvath and Siloni propose that V can remerge at the root of the current VP, 
providing space, i. e. a speciﬁer, for the extra argument. For example, after [VP Mary give a book] is 
built, give is remerged to yield [VP John [give [Mary give a book]]]. The asymmetries between the 
arguments follow from the order of merger, which itself follows from a modiﬁcation of Reinhart’s 
merging instructions in (1): (i) [–] clusters are merged by the ﬁrst merger of V; (ii) [+] clusters are 
merged by the last merger of V; (iii) mixed clusters ([+c–m] and [–c+m]) are merged either by the 
second (including vacuous) or last merger of V, depending on whether there is already a [+] clus-
ter. These rules explain different realization of mixed clusters as in Max peeled the apple with the 
knife vs. The knife peeled the apple and His health worries John vs. John worries about his health.
Horvath and Siloni present three arguments against syntacticocentric approaches and in favor 
of the active lexicon. First, arity operations can have selectional restrictions that are easier deﬁned 
in terms of TS features than in terms of functional heads, e. g. Hungarian causativization, which 
requires a [+] argument [Horva th, Siloni 2011]. Second, reduction operations (e. g. Expletiviza-
tion, deriving Unaccusative / subject Experiencer verbs) do not make sense in the syntax assuming 
syntax does not destroy structure, whereas nothing precludes eliminating clusters from a concept 
(= a set of clusters) in TS. This is explained in TS by placing such operations in the (active) lex-
icon, which is achieved by Reinhart and Siloni’s [2005] Lex-Syn parameter.7
Third, arity operations can be lexically restricted in some languages (e. g. Russian -sja reﬂex-
ivization). Although Horvath and Siloni effectively destroy arguments for syntacticocentric ap-
proaches, their arguments against such approaches are not deﬁnitive. First, the argument against 
reduction in syntax begs the question as to whether unaccusative and subject Experiencer alterna-
tions cannot be accounted for without reduction, as, for instance, in [Ramchand 2008]. Second, the 
argument from the thematic sensitivity of arity operations also begs the question as to whether such 
sensitivity cannot be captured by syntactic selection for different functional heads (encoding differ-
ent external arguments), as, for example, in Folli and Harley’s [2005] “ﬂavors” of v approach. Thus, 
in order to evaluate Horvath and Siloni’s ﬁrst two arguments, one needs an explicit side-by-side com-
parison between TS and the aforementioned approaches, which is unfortunately missing in Horvath 
 
7 In Chapter III, Marelj and Reuland present an additional argument against the view that roots are category-
neutral, which is often associated with Borer / Distributed Morphology. The argument concerns verbalizing 
morphemes in Sakha [Vinokurova 2005]. Although such morphemes are highly productive, they still resist 
inherently “verbal” roots like ‘cut’ (and similarly for nominalizing morphemes), suggesting that roots do 
have categorial speciﬁcation (see [Wood, Marantz 2017] for further discussion).

and Siloni’s text. However, as it is also generally missing in syntacticocentric literature, this rein-
forces Horvath and Siloni’s main point that TS / active lexicon has been abandoned without sufﬁ-
cient scrutiny. Their third argument, which might be the strongest, is discussed in the next section.
5. TS and present-day grammatical theorizing. Chapter III by Marelj and Reuland is con-
cerned with a speciﬁc proposal developed within TS, namely Reinhart and Siloni’s [2005] Lex-Syn 
parameter, rather than with TS per se. Marelj and Reuland’s aim is to bring Reinhart and Siloni’s pa-
rameter up to date with the current theoretical assumptions (i. e. minimalism). Dissatisﬁed with its 
“domain-speciﬁc” and “global” character, Marelj and Reuland attempt to reduce it to “low-level dif-
ferences in functional structure between languages” coupled with “domain-general” explanatory mech-
anisms — an agenda stemming from Reuland’s “reductionist” approach to reﬂexivity (see, e. g., [Reu-
land 2011]). Instead of restricting lexical reﬂexivization to “lexicon languages” like Russian, as envis-
aged by Reinhart and Siloni’s Lex-Syn parameter, Marelj and Reuland argue that it should in principle 
be universally available, including in “syntax languages” like Italian (the remaining differences be-
tween “lexicon” and “syntax” reﬂexives being accounted for by independent properties of clitics in the 
“syntax languages”). Thus, while rejecting a speciﬁc TS proposal (the Lex-Syn parameter), Marelj 
and Reuland’s approach supports the crucial TS assumption of active lexicon and thereby TS itself.
The aim of Marelj and Reuland is twofold: (i) to provide an alternative account of “the Lex-
Syn parameter effects” without invoking the parameter itself (i. e. the notion of a “syntax lan-
guage”), (ii) to provide an argument for the existence of lexical reﬂexivization even in what was 
described by Reinhart and Siloni as “syntax languages” (e. g. Italian), suggesting its universality.
Reinhart and Siloni’s Lex-Syn parameter is motivated by the contrast between lexically re-
stricted (simplex) reﬂexives like Dutch zich in (6), and reﬂexive clitics like Italian si in (7). While 
zich is mostly restricted to grooming verbs, as in (6a), and is blocked with verbs like ‘admire’, 
as in (6b) (cf. Russian reﬂexive -sja in *Ivan uvažaetsja), si is fully productive.8 On Reinhart and 
Siloni’s account, the contrast follows if Bundling, i. e. the operation deriving reﬂexive predicates, 
is parameterized as occurring in the lexicon in languages like Russian or Dutch (hence lexically-
restricted) and as occurring in the syntax in languages like Italian (hence lexically-unrestricted).

(7) 
�������
 
Gianni    si    lava / ammira.
Gianni     ��    washes / admires
Marelj and Reuland propose an alternative explanation of these facts capitalizing on the ad-
ditional contrast between simplex and complex reﬂexives in (6b). They argue that the ungram-
maticality of zich in (6b) actually follows from the fact that simplex reﬂexives, being argumental 
expressions, are subject to the constraint against identical co-arguments (IDI) [Reuland 2011], 
which is circumvented by complex reﬂexives like zichzelf (“protecting” the argument, as it were). 
As for (6a), here zich is not a true argument because reﬂexivization of grooming verbs in Dutch 
is derived in the lexicon by Bundling creating a one-place predicate (with no argument slot). The 
role of zich in (6a) is merely to check the “accusative case residue.”
In order to account for why Italian si in (7) does not violate IDI, Marelj and Reuland observe 
that si independently differs from both zich and -sja in its clitic status. Assuming that clitics at-
tach to heads from argument positions, they form non-uniform A—non-A—A chains in examples 
 
8 Unfortunately, the authors do not discuss ECM reﬂexivization as in French Jean se considère intelligent 
‘Jean considers himself intelligent’, which is a hallmark of “syntactic” reﬂexivization according to [Reinhart, 
Siloni 2005].
136

like (7), as in [TP Giannii … [vP [v sii + ammira] [VP ammira sii]]]. Marelj and Reuland further as-
sume that non-uniform chains are treated by the computational system as two distinct argument 
chains and thus interpreted as two distinct arguments, thereby circumventing IDI.
Marelj and Reuland’s account of (6)—(7) is based on the assumption that both zich in (6b) 
(but not in (6a)) and si in (7) can be true arguments. To support this claim, they present evidence 
from the availability of proxy readings, which require an argumental reﬂexive, cf. Ringo načal 
razdevat sebja ‘Ringo started undressing himself’ vs. #Ringo načal razdevat’sja ‘#Ringo started 
undressing’ in the “wax museum” context. While Dutch zich in principle allows proxy readings, 
they are unavailable with grooming verbs, as in Plotseling begon Ringo zich*(zelf) te ontkleden 
‘All of a sudden Ringo started undressing.’ Such readings are also (partially) available for reﬂex-
ive clitics like Italian si supporting Marelj and Reuland’s non-uniform chain analysis.
To show that even in “syntax languages” like Italian, reﬂexivization (Bundling) must occur 
in the lexicon, Marelj and Reuland present evidence from auto-preﬁxation (cf. Russian samo-pre-
ﬁxation), illustrated in (8). They observe that auto-preﬁxation (i) disallows proxy readings in ex-
amples like (8a), and (ii) is disallowed with grooming verbs, as shown in (8b) (see [Castella 2011]). 
This pattern follows if (i) auto-preﬁxation involves Bundling in the lexicon, explaining the lack 
of proxy readings, and (ii) grooming verbs like lavare are reﬂexivized prior to auto-preﬁxation 
thereby blocking it (assuming auto-preﬁxation applies to two-place verbs).

Summarizing, Marelj and Reuland explain the empirical results of the Lex-Syn parameter 
by reducing “reﬂexivization in the syntax” to independent properties of reﬂexive clitics, simul-
taneously providing support for the potential universality of lexical reﬂexivization and thus for 
active lexicon / TS itself.
Marelj and Reuland’s contribution suggests that while the empirical results and theoretical 
assumptions of the Lex-Syn parameter / TS are mostly correct, it fails as an explanatory frame-
work as is because it lacks the degree of ﬂexibility required to capture the complexity of the data, 
which is evident from comparing its modest conceptual apparatus to that of Marelj and Reuland, 
who use a diversity of theoretical tools. On the ﬂip-side, Reinhart’s work retains a stronger “the-
oretical unity” and, in a way, provides a more “psychologically satisfactory” explanation. In fact, 
the same applies to the comparison between TS and syntacticocentric approaches (see Section 4). 
Because of its smaller “theoretical ﬂexibility,” TS is harder to tweak to gain in descriptive ade-
quacy, as opposed to syntacticocentric approaches which are “omnivorous” in being able to ac-
commodate any new data (by, for example, postulating another functional head). However, be-
cause of this very reason, TS has a much stronger explanatory potential.
From this perspective, it appears that the dominance of syntacticocentric approaches in linguistic 
practice (pace Horvath and Siloni) actually stems from the fact that most formal linguists working 
on argument structure place greater premium on the accurate description of the observed phenomena 
rather than “deep explanations.” Syntacticocentric approaches become the approaches of choice be-
cause they are more suited to such description. Whether this characterization is true, the lesson pro-
vided by the discussion of TS in the reviewed book, beyond its doubtless theoretical and empirical 
value for specialists working on argument structure, is that linguists should be more aware of the theo-
retical choices they make and should reﬂect more on the development and progress of linguistics.
