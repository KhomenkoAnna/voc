Abstract: This paper provides a ﬁ rst syntactic description of relativization in Russian Sign Language (RSL). 
We collected production data from nine signers performing a picture-based task. The signers produced 
88 instances of relative constructions with the head noun being the subject or direct object in the main 
clause and in the relative clause. We found that RSL has head-external (postnominal) relative clauses, 
head-internal relative clauses, and double-headed relative clauses. Relative clauses might also be extra-
posed to the sentence-ﬁ nal position or fronted. The main clause may be doubled, so that a part of it is 
repeated after the relative clause. Relative clauses might contain optional relative elements ����� and 
�����, in clause-initial or clause-ﬁ nal position, or in both positions, and the two elements can co-occur. 
Finally, we found that relative clauses are nearly always prosodically separate from the main clause. 
The most frequent non-manual markers in relative construction are eye blinks; in addition, head leans 
and turns, eyebrow raise, and squints are sometimes used. However, no marker is specialized for mark-
ing the relative clause itself: they either are simply markers of boundaries of prosodic units (eye blinks), 
or they have some other functions (which we cannot fully identify yet). We conclude that RSL gener-
ally ﬁ ts patterns found in other spoken and signed languages. However, we also observe speciﬁ c dif-
ferences, especially in the domain of non-manual marking.

в роли подлежащего или прямого дополнения в главной и относительной клаузах. Мы обна-
ружили, что РЖЯ использует постноминальные относительные клаузы с внешней вершиной, 
а также клаузы с внутренней и с двойной вершиной. Главная клауза может подвергаться удвое-
нию, так что ее часть повторяется после относительной клаузы. Относительная клауза может со-
держать необязательные относительные элементы ������� и �� (указательный жест) в началь-
ной либо конечной позиции, или же в обеих позициях в относительной клаузе, и эти элементы 
могут комбинироваться. Наконец, мы обнаружили, что относительные придаточные практически 
всегда просодически обособлены от главной клаузы. Самыми частыми немануальными марке-
рами в конструкциях с относительными придаточными являются моргания; кроме того, иногда 
используются повороты и наклоны головы, поднятие бровей и прищур. В то же время, ни один 
из этих маркеров не является исключительно маркером относительных придаточных: все они или 
просто маркируют границы просодических единиц (моргания), или имеют другие функции (ко-
торые мы пока не можем полностью идентифицировать). Мы делаем вывод, что относительные 
придаточные РЖЯ в целом соответствует паттернам, обнаруженным в других жестовых и зву-
ковых языках. Тем не менее, мы также обнаружили конкретные отличия РЖЯ от других языков, 
особенно в области немануального маркирования.

Introduction
Relativization concerns complex sentences containing a main (matrix) clause and a relative 
clause, where the relative clause and the matrix clause share a pivotal element (a noun phrase) 
[Branchini 2014]. The function of the relative clause is usually to delimit the reference of the 
noun phrase [Andrews 2007].
Relative clauses have been thoroughly investigated in spoken language research in various 
disciplines and frameworks. Both large-scale typologies and detailed formal accounts of rela-
tive clauses in certain languages exist [Dryer 2013a; De Vries M. 2002]. However, as in many 
other domains, these typologies and theories often ignore data from a large class of natural lan-
guages, namely sign languages.
While not aiming to amend this situation directly, here we provide a ﬁ rst description of the 
syntactic properties of relativization in Russian Sign Language (RSL) in the hope that it can 
be further used for comparison with other sign and spoken languages. In addition, such a de-
scription can contribute to the emerging ﬁ eld of studying complex sentences and subordination 
in sign languages [Herrmann et al. 2016]. Besides the description of basic features, we brieﬂ y 
demonstrate how relativization in RSL is both similar and diﬀ erent to what has been described 
for other spoken and sign languages.
In Section 1, we brieﬂ y introduce relativization in spoken languages, and in Section 2 rel-
ativization in sign languages. Section 3 describes the methods. The main results are presented 
in Section 4, and discussion follows in Section 5. The ﬁ nal section presents the conclusions.
1. Typology of relativization
Relative clauses have been a focus of much descriptive, typological, psycholinguistic, and 
theoretical research. A recent overview of typology of relative clauses is provided in [Andrews 
50 
Voprosy Jazykoznanija 
2020. № 6
2007]. We will not discuss all the aspects of relative clauses that have been studied, focusing in-
stead on the syntactic aspects of relativization.1
The ﬁ rst major parameter concerns the syntactic position of the relative clause with respect 
to the matrix clause. A distinction is usually made between embedded and adjoined relative 
clauses: in the former, the relative clause modiﬁ es the noun phrase and is thus embedded in the 
main clause, while in the latter the relative clause is adjoined at the clause level. Embedded rel-
ative clauses can be further subdivided into head external (the head noun belongs to the matrix 
clause, and is not overtly realized in the relative clause (1)) and head internal (the head noun re-
mains in the relative clause (2)). In addition, free relative clauses on the surface lack the head 
noun altogether (3) (this type usually coexists with headed relative clauses).2 Finally, another 
rare type exists: double-headed relative clauses, where the head noun is overtly realized in both 
clauses (4).

‘The sago that they gave is ﬁ nished.’ [de Vries L. 1993: 78, cited in Dryer 2013a]
Externally-headed relative clauses can be further classiﬁ ed into pre-nominal and post-nom-
inal. It has been shown that there is a relation between the position of such relative clauses and 
the order of main constituents: if language has the VO order, it almost always has postnominal 
relative clauses [Dryer 2013b].
A separate type of adjoined relative clauses is often distinguished under the label of correla-
tive clauses [Lipták 2009]. Correlatives have received a lot of attention in recent years as they 
are syntactically distinct from embedded relative clauses. In correlative constructions, the rela-
tive clause does not show signs of syntactic subordination. It usually has some special relative 
marker (which can co-occur with the head noun inside the same clause), and in the main clause 
the head noun is usually accompanied by a demonstrative. In addition, correlative clauses usu-
ally precede the main clause [Ibid.].

‘The girl who is standing is tall.’ [Srivastav 1991: 642]
The diﬀ erent types of relative clauses occur with diﬀ erent frequencies in the (spoken) languages 
of the world. According to Dryer [2013a], externally-headed relative clauses are the dominant 
strategy in 87 % of all languages (based on the data from 824 languages), and 70 % of all languages 
have post-nominal head-external relative clauses as the dominant strategy. Internally-headed rel-
ative clauses are the main strategy in just 3 % of the sample, and correlatives in 1 %. However, 
 
1 Relative clauses have diﬀ erent semantic types, not discussed in this paper. Most prominently, restrictive 
and appositive (non-restrictive) relative clauses can be distinguished: the former restrict the meaning 
of the head noun they modify, while the latter specify the meaning of the head noun [De Vries M. 2002].
 
2 Going beyond the surface level, some researchers argued that free relative clauses are in fact head-inter-
nal, headed by the wh-word [Bresnan, Grimshaw 1978], also argued for sign languages by Donati & Cec-
chetto [2011], and other complex proposals not treating free realtive clauses as lacking the head also exist 
[Caponigro 2002]. Furthermore, free relatives can be classiﬁ ed in multiple sub-types [De Vries M. 2002].

as Dryer himself points out for internally-headed relative clauses, and as can be said looking 
at recent research on correlatives, these types are probably more frequent than it seems, because 
they have been recognized only recently, so many older descriptions might not mention them.
The second major parameter concerns marking of the head noun within the relative clause 
[Andrews 2007]. This parameter mainly concerns externally-headed relative and correlative 
clauses. Some languages use relative pronouns: specialized forms of pronouns that are not used 
in main clauses as argument pronouns (6). It is important to distinguish such pronouns from rel-
ative markers or complementizers as the English that in (1): the latter are not pronouns, as they 
do not show person marking.
(6) 
The boy [who was sick]RC left.
Some languages use regular resumptive pronouns in relative clauses (7). Finally, many lan-
guages allow or require full omission of the head noun in the relative clause (8).
(7) 
raʔit-i   ʔet    ha-yeled   she-/ʔasher   rina    ʔohevet   ʔoto 
Hebrew
saw-I    ���   the-boy     ���           Rina   loves      him
‘I saw the boy that Rina loves.’ [Borer 1984, cited in Andrews 2007: 220]
(8) 
The boy [I saw __ ]RC left. 
The third dimension of variation is how the relative clause as a whole is marked. In many 
languages it is introduced by some complementizer showing its subordinate status (see exam-
ples (1), (5), (7)), and in some languages it can be reduced and/or nominalized to some extent, 
for instance, through the use of non-ﬁ nite verbal morphology (as in (4) above) [Andrews 2007]. 
As we discuss in the next section, and also in Section 4, sign languages have another special-
ized way of marking relative clauses, namely non-manual markers.
Finally, an important issue in typology and theory of relative clauses concerns the so-called 
Accessibility Hierarchy [Keenan, Comrie 1977], which concerns the grammatical function of the 
head noun in the relative clause. While all languages seem to allow the head noun to be the sub-
ject of the relative clause, direct object relativization is less frequently possible, indirect object 
relativization even less so, etc. While this is an important topic, we will not further discuss it 
in this paper, as we have not tested this hierarchy for RSL. Instead, we focus on relativization 
of subjects and objects only.
2. Relativization in sign languages
Relative clauses have been studied for several sign languages, including American Sign Lan-
guage (ASL) [Liddell 1978], German Sign Language (DGS) [Pfau, Steinbach 2005], Italian Sign 
Language (LIS) [Branchini, Donati 2009; Cecchetto et al. 2006], French Sign Language [Hauser, 
Geraci 2018], Israeli Sign Language [Dachkovsky 2018], and Turkish Sign Language [Kubus, 
Nuhbalaoglu 2018]. A recent overview can be found in [Branchini, Kelepir 2017].
The same typological dimensions that were developed for spoken languages also apply to sign 
languages. For instance, externally-headed relative clauses can be found (9),3 as well as internally 
headed relative clauses (10), double-headed relative clauses (11), and free relative clauses (12). 
One language can have several or all of these strategies, as is the case, for instance, in Turkish 
Sign Language [Kubus, Nuhbalaoglu 2018].
 
3 Glossing conventions: Signs are glossed in small caps. ����� is a pointing sign, with lowercase number 
referring to the person. ����-� — human relative pronoun (in DGS). ����� is a relative sign in RSL. 
Non-manual markers are placed above the glosses, with underscore showing their scope. See the full 
list of abbreviations in the end of the paper.

Some authors have analyzed some of the relative constructions as correlatives, for instance, 
Cechetto et al. [2006] for LIS, while others have argued against such an analysis [Branchini, 
Donati 2009].
Some sign languages employ relative pronouns or other relative signs. DGS, for instance, 
uses two diﬀ erent types of pronouns depending on whether the head noun is human or non-hu-
man [Pfau, Steinbach 2005]. ASL has a relative sign ���� which can occur in the clause-ﬁ nal 
position [Liddell 1978].
An important feature of relative clauses in sign languages is that they are usually marked 
by non-manual markers. Some of the markers commonly mentioned in the literature are squinted 
eyes, raised eyebrows, and head movement. While for some sign languages non-manual mark-
ers have been claimed to be nearly obligatory [Branchini, Donati 2009], others have found much 
variation in the presence and type of non-manual marking [Kubus, Nuhbalaoglu 2018]. Dac-
hkovsky [2018] argues that non-manual marking of relative clauses in Israeli Sign Language 
(squints and forward head movement) has recently undergone grammaticalization, so that that 
younger signers use it in a more regular and systematic way than older signers.
It is worth noting that many of the studies of relative clauses in sign languages are concerned 
with oﬀ ering a formal analysis of the syntactic structure in the Generative Grammar framework 
[Branchini, Donati 2009; Cecchetto et al. 2006; Pfau, Steinbach 2005; Hauser, Geraci 2018]. 
Since we do not have a similar purpose in this paper, we do not discuss these analyses further.
3. Current study
3.1. Russian Sign Language
RSL is a natural sign language used by deaf and hard-of-hearing people in Russia. Accord-
ing to the 2010 census, 120 000 people are signers of RSL.4 It emerged at the beginning of the 
19th century when the ﬁ rst school for the deaf was established. RSL has been claimed to be his-
torically related to French Sign Language, although not all researchers agree with this position 
[Bickford 2005].
While RSL is less well studied than ASL or DGS, some linguistic research has appeared in re-
cent years. Most relevant for this paper is Kimmelman [2012], who described basic word order 
in simple sentence, and Burkova [2012], who described conditionals in RSL: probably, the ﬁ rst

description of complex clauses in this language. A small-scale annotated corpus of RSL has been 
created recently, and can be found at http://rsl.nstu.ru/site/index/language/en [Burkova 2015].
Importantly, RSL exists in constant contact with Russian, a situation common among the 
so-called urban sign languages [Zeshan 2008]. First, almost all signers also learn at least writ-
ten Russian at school. Second, there exists a manual communication system, Signed Russian, 
which means using Russian (sometimes with voice, and sometimes with silent articulation) ac-
companied with RSL signs. Singed Russian is not a natural language, but a system of transfer-
ring Russian into the visual-manual channel. Thus, it lacks many of the grammatical features 
of RSL and follows the rules of Russian wherever possible. For historical reasons, Signed Rus-
sian is used a lot in deaf education and in sign language interpreting, and it has a high status 
even among deaf signers. Because of the constant contact between RSL and (Signed) Russian, 
we can observe many contact phenomena, such as borrowing and code-switching. This is also 
true to some extent for relative constructions, as we show in Section 4.
3.2. Participants
Although a corpus of RSL exists, it could not be used for the current study of relativization. 
First, the size of the corpus is quite small (under 6 hours of signing). Second, given that the cur-
rent study is the ﬁ rst ever research on relativization in RSL, it was not clear how to search for 
and identify potential relative constructions in the corpus. We therefore collected novel produc-
tion data from nine RSL signers. The procedure is described in the next section.
The sociolinguistic characteristics of the signers are summarized in the Table. The same la-
bels for signers are used in all examples below.5 While most signers are from Moscow, three 
signers are from other cities, so some amount of dialectal variation cannot be excluded. Fur-
thermore, only ﬁ ve of the signers have deaf parents; however, the other signers are very ﬂ uent 
and use RSL as their main language.

3.3. Stimuli and procedure
To elicit relative constructions, we used a task commonly employed for this purpose. We pre-
sented signers with pairs of pictures (most of which were designed for this study speciﬁ cally) 
that were similar, but diﬀ erent in exactly two aspects. For instance, in one pair (Figure 1), the 
left picture contains a boy sitting down and holding a book, and the right picture contains the 
same boy standing up and holding a pot.
Figure 1. A picture used for data elicitation.
The task was conducted in RSL by the ﬁ rst author. First, the signer was asked to describe 
both pictures to make sure that they noticed the relevant details (these descriptions were not an-
alyzed further). Second, two questions were asked about the pictures: the ﬁ rst one formulated 
in a way so that the potential head noun would be the subject of the main clause, and the second 
one in a way so that the head noun would be the object of the verb ���� (which is a transitive 
verb in RSL) (13). Other similar pictures were used to elicit sentences where the head would be 
the object and the subject of the relative clause, too. In other words, we tried to elicit four types 
of constructions: with head noun being the subject/object in the main/relative clauses.
(13) Question 1:         “Which of the boys is reading a book?”
 
Expected answer:   “The boy who is sitting is reading a book.”
 
(the head is the subject in both the relative and main clauses)
 
Question 2:         “Which of the boys do you like more?”
 
Expected answer:   “I like the boy who is sitting/reading a book.”
 
(the head is the subject in the relative clause and the object in the main clause)
The data collection was conducted in two separate sessions. Signers 1–8 participated in the 
ﬁ rst session, which also included additional stimuli aimed at eliciting relativization of adjuncts. 
However, the data with adjunct relativization was not satisfactory, as the signers were mostly 
using ways of describing pictures without a relative clause (see below). We decided to leave the 
question of whether adjuncts could be relativized for future research. In the second stage, we 
created new pictures to elicit only subject and object relativization, and signers 1, 8, 9, and 10 
participated. Signers 1 and 8 thus participated in both rounds; however, due to the fact that there 
was a six months period between the sessions, and that in the second session we used other stim-
uli, we do not think it aﬀ ected our data.
In the ﬁ rst round, the stimuli were designed to elicit 12 target sentences with relative clauses 
(disregarding the adjuncts), and in the second round, 16 target sentences. This would result in 132 
 
 Evgeniya A. Khristoforova, Vadim I. Kimmelman 
55
sentences based on the two sessions. However, the signers did not always produce sentences that 
could be further analyzed. First, in some cases they produced sentences not directly answering the 
question that was asked of them. Second, they sometimes used an alternative strategy, such as for in-
stance saying “The girl with the ball is sitting” instead of the target “The girl that is holding the ball is 
sitting”. Finally, some situations were described with very long sequences of clauses with no obvious 
relativization. After discarding such cases, we were left with 88 instances of relative constructions.
3.4. Acceptability judgments
For a related project which will not be discussed in detail in this paper, we also collected 
acceptability judgments for some speciﬁ c types of relative constructions. Four signers partici-
pated in this task: signers 1, 4 and 8 (see above), and one other native signer. They were asked 
to judge signed productions of various sentences by the ﬁ rst author, and correct them if neces-
sary. We used judgments to assess possible syntactic positions of relative signs, among other 
phenomena. We do not systematically analyze this judgment data for this paper; however, we 
mention it once below (25).
3.5. Annotation and analysis
We annotated the data using ELAN [Crasborn, Sloetjes 2008]. For each example, we anno-
tated non-manual markers and their scope, the position of the head (in which clause the lexical 
sign surfaces), the syntactic roles of the head in the main and relative clauses, the type and po-
sition of the relative sign, and the overall syntactic structure of the construction.
Note that in determining the position of the head (whether it is in the relative clause or in the 
main clause) we used the surface position of the head lexical sign whenever possible: e.g., if 
the head is not even adjacent to the relative clause, it is clear that it is in the main clause, and 
if the head is embedded in the relative clause (surrounded by other signs belonging to the rela-
tive clause), it is clear that it is in the relative clause. However, quite often the surface position 
of the head is compatible with it belonging to either clause. For instance, if the head is the ob-
ject of the main clause and the subject of the relative clause, and the relative clause follows the 
main clause, given that RSL has the basic SVO order [Kimmelman 2012], the head can be in-
terpreted as belonging to either clause:
(14) Subject Verb-main head Verb-relative 
 
Subject Verb-main Object [ __ Verb-relative]  — a head-external relative clause OR
 
Subject Verb-main [Subject Verb-relative]    — a head-internal relative clause
In such cases, we used prosodic (non-manual) markers as a criterion to determine clause 
boundaries. So, if in (14) there is a prosodic boundary before the head noun, we would con-
sider it head-internal, and if there is a prosodic boundary after the noun, we would consider it 
head-external. As we discuss in Section 4.5, some type of such non-manual marking is always 
available. While prosodic constituents do not have to correlate perfectly with syntactic constit-
uents, we argue that as a last resort prosodic marking is a reasonable criterion to determine syn-
tactic boundaries [Crasborn 2007].
Another cue was the position of a relative sign. As we assumed that certain types of relative 
signs in RSL marked the relative clause boundary, the head noun preceding these relative signs 
were considered to be external to relative clause. In most cases, this criterion correlated with 
the prosodic criterion above.

4. Basic features of relativization
4.1. Headedness
In this section, we describe the head position in the relative construction, and brieﬂ y address 
the question whether the RSL relative constructions should be analyzed as correlatives.
The RSL examples in the rest of this paper are accompanied with video ﬁ les with the exception 
of one example from the acceptability judgment elicitation — see the link in the end of the paper.
RSL turns out to have all possible types of relative clauses with respect to headedness: exter-
nally headed, internally headed, and double-headed. Example (15) shows an externally headed 
relative clause: the head noun ��� occurs in the object position of the main clause, while the 
relative clause is extraposed, and prosodically separated from the main clause by an eye blink.6 
In contrast, (16) shows an internally headed relative clause, as the head ���� occurs between 
the object and the verb of this clause, and not in the main clause.7 Finally, (17) shows a sen-
tence where the head noun ��� occurs both in the main clause and in the relative clause; ����� 
is a relative sign (see Section 4.3).

In addition, some examples of headless relative clauses were produced, probably because 
the head was recoverable from the context (the question asked), as in (18). Note that the head 
is not completely absent, as there are pointing signs referring to it in both the relative and the 
main clauses.

The most common type of relative clause is the externally headed relative clause (45 in-
stances), followed by the internally headed relative clause (16 instances), and the double-headed 
construction (11 instances), as well as headless relative clauses (10 instances). In 6 cases we 
were not able to determine the structure well enough. Note however that given the sample size, 
conclusions about relative frequency cannot be drawn. What is clear is that all types of headed-
ness are possible in RSL.
Given the ﬂ exibility of the head position in relative constructions in RSL, it might be attrac-
tive to oﬀ er a uniﬁ ed analysis of all cases as a correlative construction, as correlatives allow 
head realization in the relative clause, matrix clause, or both [Bhatt 2003; Lipták 2009]. How-
ever, there are several arguments against such uniﬁ ed analysis.
First, the relative clause in correlatives almost universally occurs in the sentence-initial posi-
tion [Lipták 2009]. However, as examples above show, relative clauses in RSL can occur in the

sentence-ﬁ nal position, and they can also be embedded in the argument position within the ma-
trix clause (see also the discussion in the next section). Second, typologically, a demonstrative 
is usually required in the matrix clause in correlative constructions. Examples (15)–(17) above 
show that this is not the case in RSL.
While a uniﬁ ed correlative analysis for the relative constructions in RSL is thus unlikely, it 
is very possible that a correlative construction exists in RSL, as many languages have multi-
ple syntactically diﬀ erent strategies of relativization. Nevertheless, the possibility of several 
relativization strategies makes it hard to distinguish correlative constructions from fronted 
relative clauses. The main challenge is to determine the dependent vs. independent syntactic 
status of the relative clause in this case. The data from production task did not reveal any ex-
amples with distinguishable correlative constructions, i.e. relative constructions with a fronted 
unambiguously syntactically independent relative clause. Therefore, we leave this topic for 
the future research.
4.2. Position of the relative clause
An important dimension of variation in relative constructions is the position of the rela-
tive clause.8 Here RSL also has several options; however, not all theoretical possibilities are 
attested.
Concerning externally headed relative clauses, they can either follow the head noun imme-
diately, as in (19), or be extraposed to the sentence-ﬁ nal position, as in (15) above, or be extra-
posed to the sentence-initial position, as in (20). Interestingly, these relative clauses never im-
mediately precede the head noun.

‘I like the ﬂ ower that a girl is drawing.’
Another interesting observation is that the majority of externally headed relative clauses are 
extraposed to the ﬁ nal position, or at least can be analyzed as extraposed (that is, they are not 
followed by any material from the matrix clause). In fact, there are only 5 cases similar to ex-
ample (19), where the relative clause is fully embedded in the main clause. Given the size of the 
dataset, more research is desirable.
In contrast to externally headed relatives, double-headed relative clauses (although being too 
few to make any generalizations) tend to directly follow the head in the main clause (17) — we 
observed 6 cases of post-nominal double-headed relatives. However, extraposition to the sen-
tence-ﬁ nal and sentence-initial positions are also attested.
Internally-headed relative clauses cannot be positioned with respect to the head in the main 
clause, but there still remain options: they can either occur in the position of the argument in the 
main clause, or they can be extraposed. However, in our data, it is often diﬃ  cult to distinguish 
between these two options. Internally-headed relative clauses related to the object occur in the 
ﬁ nal (post-verbal) position (21) (except for one case), so such examples are compatible with 
both in-situ analysis and the extraposition analysis. The ones related to the subject of the main 
clause are less frequent in general: there are only 4 cases, 2 of which occur pre-verbally (in situ) 
(22), and two post-verbally (23).

Concerning the headless relative clauses in our data, they are mostly related to the subject 
of the main clause, and they can occur both pre-verbally (which can be interpreted as in situ) 
and post-verbally (that is, possibly extraposed).
4.3. Relative signs
Concerning relative signs, RSL has three main options. First, a relative clause might lack any 
such sign, as in (15)–(16). Both head-internal and head-external relative clauses can occur without 
any relative sign. In fact, this is the most common single strategy, occurring in 35 cases in our data.
Second, a relative sign ����� ‘which/that’ can be used, either alone or in combination with 
a pointing sign (see e.g. (19) and (22)). Third, a pointing sign �����3 referring to the head noun 
might occur, as in (24). It is also possible for the latter two strategies to be combined, as in (23) 
above, where the relative sign ����� in the initial position co-occurs with the pointing sign ��-
���3 in the ﬁ nal position.

(24) ���   ���� ���������        [�����3 ��� ���   �����3]RC 
[s8]
‘The dog that the boy hugs is more beautiful.’
The sign ����� has some relation to the Russian relative pronoun kotoryj ‘which’. This re-
lation is clear from the mouthing of the Russian word that often accompanies this sign; how-
ever, the sign itself is not based on ﬁ ngerspelling or initialization, so its manual part is not re-
lated to the Russian word. Note also that the same sign is used as a demonstrative ‘this’, with the 
mouthing of the Russian word ètot ‘this’. Another symptom of this signs’ connection to spoken 
(and Signed) Russian is the fact that, in explicit judgment tasks, the signers are somewhat unwill-
ing to accept it, not being sure whether it belongs to the core RSL, or is a contact phenomenon.
At the same time, the distribution of this sign is quite diﬀ erent from the corresponding Rus-
sian relative pronoun. Firstly, while the Russian relative pronoun always occurs clause-initially, 
����� can occur clause-initially, as in (17) and (23), clause-ﬁ nally, as in (18) and (22), or it 
can be doubled, as in (27) below. There is also an interesting pattern that emerged in elicitation 
of acceptability judgments. It turns out that the clause-ﬁ nal use of ����� is only possible in in-
ternally headed relative clauses preceding the main clause (25), while there is no such restric-
tion for the clause-initial use of �����.

9 The diﬀ erence between the ﬁ rst and third options in (25) is prodosic: in the latter but not the former, the 
head noun is prosodically separate from the relative clause, which is signaled by a dedicated non-man-
ual marker, i.e. an eye blink.

Secondly, unlike in Russian, where the head noun is always external to the relative clause, 
����� in RSL can also occur in internally headed relative clauses, as in (23) and (25) above, 
as well as in double headed relative clauses, as in (17) above.
Finally, while the Russian relative pronoun kotoryj can also be used as a question word, the 
RSL sign ����� is not used as such. We thus conclude that even if ����� was introduced via 
Signed Russian, it is a part of the grammar of RSL now.
An important question is whether ����� should be analyzed as a relative pronoun or a rel-
ativizer. The crucial diﬀ erence between the two is whether the element manifests agreement 
with the head noun [De Vries M. 2002]. ����� itself does not show agreement, and thus should 
probably be classiﬁ ed as a complementizer.
However, an interesting feature of ����� is that it is sometimes accompanied with a point-
ing sign (mostly in the order ����� �����3). Importantly, quite often ����� and the pointing 
sign are prosodically connected. Speciﬁ cally, the mouthing of the Russian word kotoryj always 
spreads to the pointing sign, and the passive hand from ����� is often maintained in its conﬁ g-
uration and location while the pointing sign is produced (Figure 2). These processes are indic-
ative of the two signs forming one phonological word [Nespor, Sandler 1999]. Given that, we 
may think of it as a host + clitic construction with a cliticized index sign functioning as an agree-
ment marker (for more details on cliticization in sign languages see [Sandler 1999]) and thus 
it might be reasonable to suggest that the combination of ����� and �����3 is in fact a relative 
pronoun, and not a complementizer.
Figure 2. ����� and �����3 demonstrate spreading of the mouthing and 
of the passive hand. The second frame shows the downward �����3 on the 
right hand. Note the continued mouthing on the second frame.
We now turn to �����3, which can occur separately in relative clauses. �����3 can occur 
clause-initially, clause-ﬁ nally, or be doubled (24). It occurs in both head-internal and head-ex-
ternal relative clauses.
The sign itself is a simple pointing sign that can also be used as a pronoun in simple clauses, 
and as a determiner or demonstrative in noun phrases. Therefore, one might ask why pointing 
signs occurring in relative clauses should be analyzed as relative signs, and not as resumptive 
pronouns or determiners. We observed that quite often pointing sings in relative clauses occur 
in clause-initial and/or clause-ﬁ nal position, diﬀ erent from the argument that it refers to. For in-
stance, in (24) repeated here as (26), there are two pointing signs. Even if the former can be 
analyzed as a determiner, the latter does not occur in the subject position and does not modify 
a noun, so we analyze it as a relative sign.

On the other hand, many examples that we ﬁ nd in our dataset are indeed ambiguous: the 
pointing sign can often be analyzed as either being a clause-initial relative pronoun or a resump-
tive subject pronoun, or as either a clause-ﬁ nal relative pronoun or a resumptive object pronoun.
Unlike �����, for �����3 it is clear that it can only be a (relative) pronoun, and not a com-
plementizer, because it shows spatial agreement with the head noun (that is, it is directed to the 
location associated with the head noun).
Finally, as mentioned above, sometimes ����� occurs in the initial position, and �����3 
in the ﬁ nal position, as in (23). The opposite pattern is not attested; however, given the restric-
tions on the ﬁ nal position of ����� discussed above, this could have happened by accident 
in our dataset.
4.4. Main clause doubling
A prominent feature of our dataset is that quite often the main clause (or a part of it) is re-
peated after the relative clause (24 cases). For instance, in (27) the verb ��� from the main clause 
occurs both before and after the internally headed relative clause.10
 
      br
(27) ���� ���   [����� �����3 ���� ���� ��� ��� �����3 �����]RC ���

‘The girl that pets a cat is sitting.’
Importantly, all relative constructions with main clause doubling except for two cases are 
observed in the context of sentence-ﬁ nal relative clauses (base-generated or extraposed). Dou-
bling in general is a very common phenomenon in sign languages, including RSL [Kimmel-
man 2013]. However, the status of this phenomenon is not clear. One could analyze examples 
like (27) as a simple discourse-level repetition (see for instance [Stolz et al. 2011]). However, 
given the frequency of doubling, and its interaction with grammar and information structure, 
at least some cases are more reasonably analyzed as a syntactic process (as e.g. in [Corver, 
Nunes 2007]).
Irrespective of the speciﬁ c analysis of doubling in RSL, we want to make two points. First, 
main clause doubling is indeed a frequent phenomenon in relative constructions in RSL. Sec-
ond, the tendency for the relative clauses to occur in the ﬁ nal position discussed above is some-
what mitigated by doubling: relative clauses are often followed by the doubled elements from 
the main clause. We return to this issue in Section 5.
4.5. Non-manual marking
In RSL, as in other sign languages, non-manual marking plays an important role in the rel-
ative constructions. In fact, as discussed in Section 3.5, we used non-manual marking as one 
of the criteria to determine clause boundaries, and therefore headedness of relative clauses in our 
data. While non-manual markers are important across sign languages, the speciﬁ c markers vary. 
RSL non-manual markers also present an interesting pattern.
The ﬁ rst observation that can be made is that there are almost no examples where a boundary 
between the main and the relative clause is not marked in some way. A case that comes closest 
to this is example (28); however, the ﬁ nal sign in the main clause (�����.����) is held for some 
time, and also a slight nod during the hold marks the boundary.
 10 Note that the relative sign ����� also occurs twice. This was discussed in Section 4.3.

‘I like the large book that the boy is reading.’
At the same time, we observe that no single marker obligatorily or even predominantly marks 
all relative constructions. The most common markers we found are eye blinks on the clause 
boundary (77 cases, see most examples above), head leans and turns (on the relative clause 
in 28 cases, see (22) above, but also on the main clause or a part of the main clause in 34 cases, 
see (21) above), eyebrow raise on the main clause (28 cases, see (27) above), and squint on the 
relative clause or speciﬁ cally the relative sign (17 cases, see (29)), although squints also occur 
in the main clause. These diﬀ erent markers can of course co-occur.

‘[The vase] that is broken is green.’
A very important point is that none of these non-manual markers are specialized for relative 
clauses. Eye blinks are very common markers of clause boundaries, both cross-linguistically 
[Nespor, Sandler 1999] and in RSL [Burkova 2012], irrespective of the type of clause. Eyebrow 
raise marks not the relative clause, but the main clause. It is not entirely clear what the function 
of this marker is, but it might be used in answers to explicit questions marking the main prop-
osition (see [Kimmelman 2014] for a discussion of such examples). Squints occur infrequently 
in our data (and also both on relative clauses and main clauses, or parts of them), so they cannot 
be markers of relativization per se. It is likely that they are used to mark noun phrases whose 
referents are given but not easily accessible, similar to the way they are used in other sign lan-
guages, such as DGS [Herrmann 2013]. However, given our limited dataset, we are not able 
to determine their function.
The only markers that might seem good candidates for specialized markers of relativization 
are head leans and turns. Such markers occur in a majority of cases. However, looking at them 
in more detail shows that this is not the case.
Importantly, they occur approximately equally frequently on the main clause and on the rela-
tive clause. While they are therefore useful in demonstrating the boundary between the clauses 
either way, they clearly do not unambiguously mark the clause’s function.
It is also important to note that we grouped leans and turns together, while it is not clear 
whether they should be considered the same marker. Anatomically leans and turns are not a sin-
gle phenomenon, although they might be still diﬀ erent phonetic realizations of the same pho-
nological feature (see [Crasborn, van der Kooij 2013] for a similar idea for diﬀ erent markers). 
In addition, leans can be further subdivided into sideward leans, and backward or forward leans. 
Given previous research on other sign languages [Lackner 2017] we would expect diﬀ erent 
leans to have diﬀ erent functions. However, it is not possible for us to establish these functions 
using our dataset.
The variation in marking by head leans and turns of course can be simply due to the fact that 
multiple distinct relative constructions occur in our data. However, a preliminary analysis does 
not indicate that this is the case. We can observe that head leans and turns can occur on the main 
clause or on the relative clause for both head-internal and head-external relative clauses. Simi-
larly, in relative constructions with ����� the main or the relative clause can be marked by head 
leans and turns. We are thus not able to ﬁ nd a clear factor related to the structure of the sentence 
that would predict the occurrence of these markers.
We have to conclude that relative clauses in RSL are not marked non-manually in a consistent 
way. Relative clauses are (probably obligatorily) marked by some non-manual marker as a sepa-
rate prosodic constituent, but they are not marked as relative clauses speciﬁ cally. It is possible that 
head leans and turns have some function that is related to relativization, and that some subtypes 
of relative construction in RSL do in fact use them consistently, but this is left for future research.

5. Discussion
Based on this study, we observe that relative clauses in RSL in general ﬁ t the same pat-
terns that are found in other spoken and signed languages. RSL has externally-headed, internal-
ly-headed, and double-headed relative clauses. Similar to most spoken languages [Dryer 2013a], 
the dominant pattern in RSL seems to be head-external relative clauses.
A slightly typologically unusual pattern concerns the positions of the relative pronouns ����� 
and �����, both of which can occur clause-initially, clause-ﬁ nally, or be doubled in both positions, 
or co-occur with each other. This position ﬂ exibility, and also the possibility of the clause-ﬁ nal 
position is reminiscent of another class of elements in sign languages, namely wh-signs. It has 
been observed that, while wh-words in spoken languages typically occur in the left periphery 
or in situ, in sign languages wh-signs are often doubled or occur in the clause-ﬁ nal position [Cec-
chetto 2012]. It seems that sign languages have a preference for placing some functional elements 
in the ﬁ nal position, which is not observed in spoken languages. However, relative signs in other 
sign languages investigated so far do not show such a variability in the position and none of them 
employed both clause-initial and clause-ﬁ nal relative signs in the same relative construction.
Another domain in which RSL data seems somewhat unusual is the amount of variation. As we 
discussed above, RSL has several syntactic strategies of relativization, and non-manual mark-
ing is also very variable. If we compare our ﬁ ndings to some reports on other sign languages 
[Liddell 1978; Pfau, Steinbach 2005; Branchini, Donati 2009], it might seem that RSL shows 
more variation. However, a recent corpus-based study of Turkish Sign Language [Kubus, Nuh-
balaoglu 2018] also shows a large amount of variation in relativization strategies. We suspect 
that the amount of variation we found in RSL is not indicative of its typological peculiarity, but 
is an artifact of the methodology: when relying on mostly unguided picture-based production, 
as we did, or even more so on corpus data, as Kubus & Nuhbalaoglu did, one ﬁ nds more varia-
tion than when relying on judgment data from a small number of signers/speakers.
Another diﬀ erence between our ﬁ ndings and many of the descriptions of other sign languages 
concerns the non-manual marking. Apart from observing a lot of variation, we also have to con-
clude that we do not ﬁ nd any specialized non-manual markers of relative clauses (nor specialized 
combinations of markers). Here we might face a real domain of typological variation between the 
sign languages. Diﬀ erent markers are used in diﬀ erent languages, and with diﬀ erent regularity.
A parallel can be drawn to non-manual markers of negation in sign languages [Oomen, Pfau 
2017]. First, while most sign languages use negative headshakes, others, such as Turkish Sign 
Language, also use negative backward tilts. Second, while in some languages non-manual marker 
alone is enough to express negation (e.g. in ASL), in others the presence of the manual sign is 
required (e.g. in LIS). Some authors thus use the distinction between non-manually dominant 
and manually-dominant sign languages (although see [Johnston 2018] for a recent critical eval-
uation). Similarly, both the form and the function of non-manual markers in relative clauses vary 
between sign languages. It might be interesting to see whether the use of non-manuals across 
domains (negation, relative clauses, question marking) shows general patterns in speciﬁ c lan-
guages. More comparative research is clearly necessary.
The ﬁ nal issue that we wanted to mention is the case when the main clause is doubled (fully 
or partially) after the relative clause in RSL. As mentioned, this strategy almost always occurs 
in the context of sentence-ﬁ nal relative clauses. We thus hypothesize that the preference for main 
clause doubling may be explained by various reasons, one of which being a consequence of cog-
nitive overload. In other words, signers might consider it necessary to repeat the main clause af-
ter the long and semantically peripheral constituent.
However, this speciﬁ c discourse strategy, which might have initially been dictated by pro-
cessing, seems to acquire grammatical functions (see also [Kimmelman 2013] for a proposal 
on grammaticalization of doubling). The ﬁ rst piece of evidence, as we have already mentioned 
previously, comes from the remarkable frequency of this strategy speciﬁ cally in RSL relative 
 
 Evgeniya A. Khristoforova, Vadim I. Kimmelman

constructions. Similar patterns were not described for relative constructions in any other sign 
language. If it were only processing issue that motivated doubling, similar constructions would 
be found in other sign languages such as DGS [Pfau, Steinbach 2005] or LSF [Hauser, Geraci 
2018], both of which employ primarily post-nominal externally headed relative clauses.
Another piece of evidence is provided by the prosody of the doubling constructions. While 
the ﬁ rst copy of the main clause is almost always separated from the relative clause by an eye 
blink, the second copy is frequently less marked prosodically. Among the 24 main clause dou-
bling constructions, only in 12 cases the main clause is marked prosodically in any way, and 
only in seven cases it is separated by an eye blink. The lack of prosodic boundaries is indirect 
evidence for the lack of syntactic boundaries.
Interestingly, while collecting acceptability judgments, we found that the sentence-initial posi-
tion of the relative clause is often preferred by signers even in case of object relatives. This con-
trasts with the more frequent sentence-ﬁ nal relative clauses in our production data. It might be the 
case that signers were more inﬂ uenced by Signed Russian in the production task, therefore produc-
ing more sentence-ﬁ nal relatives, and that they employ the doubling strategy as a last resort to turn 
a Signed Russian-like structure into a more genuine RSL structure. However, this hypothesis was not 
speciﬁ cally tested, so more research on main clause doubling is needed. In addition, more research 
is needed on grammaticalization of relative constructions and on the syntactic embedding in RSL 
in general in order to unambiguously determine the status of clauses in doubling constructions.
Summary
For a ﬁ rst description of relativization construction in RSL, we collected production data 
from nine signers performing a picture-based task. The signers produced 88 instances of rela-
tive constructions with the head noun being the subject or direct object in the main clause and 
in the relative clause.
We found that RSL has head-external (postnominal), head-internal, and double-headed rela-
tive clauses. Relative clauses might also be extraposed, typically to the sentence-ﬁ nal position. 
The main clause is sometimes doubled, so that a part of it is repeated after the relative clause. 
Relative clauses might contain relative pronouns ����� and �����, in clause-initial or clause-ﬁ -
nal position, or in both positions, and the two pronouns can co-occur. Finally, we found that rel-
ative clauses are nearly always prosodically separate from the main clause. The most frequent 
non-manual markers in relative construction are eye blinks; in addition, head leans and turns, 
eyebrow raises, and squints are sometimes used as well. However, none of them is specialized 
for marking the relative clause itself: they either are simply markers of boundaries of prosodic 
units (eye blinks), or have some other functions (which we cannot fully identify yet).
Typologically, RSL enjoys the same range of options that has been described for spoken lan-
guages. The doubling and ﬁ nal position of the relative signs might be speciﬁ c to sign languages. 
In the domain of non-manuals, we ﬁ nd both similarities and diﬀ erences with other sign languages.
This study is clearly only a ﬁ rst step in understanding relativization in RSL. The issue of rela-
tivization of adjuncts remains completely unstudied; the functions of the non-manuals that some-
times occur in relative constructions must be investigated further. Finally, a typology of non-man-
ual marking in relative clauses in sign languages seems a promising domain to research in future.
