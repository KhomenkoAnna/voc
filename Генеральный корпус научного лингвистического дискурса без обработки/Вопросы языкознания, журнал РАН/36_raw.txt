Ability and possibility in Tocharian A:
The semantics of the verbs yāt- and cämp-
and their derivatives

Abstract: There are two verbs in Tocharian A that denote potential modality: yāt- and cämp-. Their forms, 
as well as the derived abstract nouns yātlune and cämplune, are usually translated almost identically. 
A thorough analysis shows that yāt- emphasizes the aspect of probability, external to the agent, whereas 
cämp- focuses on the inner ability or potency of the agent. Yāt- demonstrates a rather impersonal and 
inactive behavior even at the level of grammar, which can be seen in the distribution of forms and some 
speciﬁ c syntactic constructions. This distinction is found in the derivatives as well. For instance, yātlune, 
unlike cämplune, is regularly described as not inherent to the owner, so it can be gained or achieved. 
While it is diﬃ  cult to ﬁ nd diﬀ erences in the core semantics of these words (i.e., ‘ability’ or ‘power’), 
yātlune has, in addition, speciﬁ c meanings, such as ‘possessions, property’ and probably ‘perfection’. 
The article also includes two supplemental parts. The ﬁ rst has to do with the adjective cämpamo, bor-
rowed from Tocharian B, and its controversial Tocharian A counterpart cämpam. The second part deals 
with the lexicalized past participle yāytu and its probable synonym sākär. As the research will show, 
both mean ‘obedient, docile’.
Keywords: modality, possibility, Tocharian

Способность и возможность в тохарском А:
семантика глаголов yāt- и cämp-
и их дериватов

Аннотация: В тохарском А языке существует два глагола, обозначающих потенциальную модаль-
ность: yāt- и cämp-. Обычно их формы, так же как и формы производных абстрактных существи-
тельных yātlune и cämplune, переводятся практически одинаково. Тщательный анализ, однако, 
показывает, что yāt- подчеркивает вероятностный аспект, внешний по отношению к деятелю, 
тогда как cämp- концентрируется на внутренней способности, потенции деятеля. Yāt- демон-
стрирует достаточно безличное и инактивное поведение даже на грамматическом уровне, что 
можно увидеть на примере распределения некоторых форм, а также в отдельных синтаксических

конструкциях. Указанное различие проявляется и в случае производных существительных. 
В частности, yātlune, в отличие от cämplune, последовательно характеризируется как нечто, что 
не является внутренне присущим носителю — yātlune можно получить или достичь. Хотя найти 
различия в базовой семантике этих слов (например, ‘способность’ или ‘могущество’) достаточно 
сложно, у yātlune есть и специфические значения, такие как ‘имущество’ и, возможно, ‘совер-
шенство’. Статья содержит две дополнительных части. Одна из них касается прилагательного 
cämpamo, пришедшего в тохарский А из тохарского B, а также аналогичного незаимствованного 
слова cämpam, связанного с рядом противоречий. Другая же часть затрагивает лексикализован-
ное причастие прошедшего времени yāytu и его вероятный синоним sākär. Как показывает наше 
исследование, оба слова означают ‘послушный, покорный’.
Ключевые слова: возможность, модальность, тохарские языки

1. Cämp- and yāt- (Grundverb)
The Tocharian languages comprise an extinct branch of the Indo-European language family, 
spoken during the ﬁ rst millennium AD in the Tarim Basin (modern Xinjiang Uyghur Autono-
mous Region, China) and discovered only in the early twentieth century. Many unsolved prob-
lems and tentative solutions remain in Tocharian, especially its lexicology. For instance, both 
languages under this branch, called Tocharian A and Tocharian B, contain the important verbs 
yāt- and cämp-, which are usually translated similarly as ‘can’ or ‘be able’ but can have quite 
distinctive meanings. In this paper I analyze Tocharian A exclusively, though the conclusions 
here may also be applicable to Tocharian B.1
It should also be mentioned that Tocharian verbs can have two (or even three) conjugational 
paradigms: the ‘basic’ Grundverb and one or two Kausativa. These terms are merely traditional. 
In fact, the valency and semantic relationships between these are highly controversial and quite 
frequently cannot be described purely in terms of causativity. For this reason, an interpretation 
of the third paradigm as the Antigrundverb [Malzahn 2010: 64 ﬀ .] has gained some traction, al-
though it is not a universally recognized concept. This term is used in this paper in order to dis-
tinguish between diﬀ erent stems, because yāt- attests this third paradigm. However, I will fo-
cus on yāt- (Antigrundverb) only brieﬂ y, as its traditional rendering seems to be unambiguous. 
(No Antigrundverb counterpart for cämp- is attested.)
As for the Grundverb paradigms of cämp- and yāt-, common translation variants are found 
in the literature. For instance, cämp- ‘be able’ [Carling et al. 2009: 195; Malzahn 2010: 635] 
and ‘können, vermögen’ [Thomas, Krause 1964: 101]. As for yāt-, ‘fähig sein, imstande sein’ 
[Thomas, Krause 1964: 128] and ‘be (cap)able’ [Malzahn 2010: 787]. However, none of these 
variants shows much of a semantic diﬀ erence. (Both verbs are translated alike in two other works: 
as ‘posse’ [Poucha 1955: 102, 239] and ‘мочь’ [Burlak, Itkin 2013: 406, 470].) Using the support 
of considerable evidence, this study attempts to show that this diﬀ erence does exist, although it 
may not always be demonstrated in every translation.
 
1 In Tocharian B, yāt- is deﬁ ned as “ ‘be capable of’ [often with inﬁ nitive complement]; ‘succeed’ (Grund-
verb), ‘have power over, control; tame’; (mediopassive) ‘be enabled’ ” (Kausativum); cämp-, as “ ‘be 
able to’ [always followed by an inﬁ nitive]” [Adams 2013: 527, 272 (respectively)].

In my view, the distinction between yāt- and cämp- could be formulated as follows:
 
1) yāt- encodes deontic modality, emphasizing the possibility or probability for the agent 
to do or achieve something, based on external conditions.
 
2) cämp- rather expresses dynamic modality, emphasizing the potency or ability of the 
agent to do or achieve something, based on its inner capability.
There are several reasons for making such a proposal for yāt-. First, its personal forms demon-
strate a rather ‘unbalanced’ distribution of tenses. There are no examples of either the preterit 
or imperfect forms, only two sentences with the present, and one with the optative. Meanwhile, 
there are at least eight examples of the subjunctive forms (which usually express the future in the 
main clause but have various meanings in the subordinate clause 2). Taking into account the lim-
ited number of entries containing yāt- (where the Grundverb paradigm is represented by around 
27 tokens), the relatively high frequency of subjunctives shows a dominant pattern.
As for the other forms of yāt-, the gerundive I, the absolutives I and II and the nt-participle 
are absent and there is only one example of the m-participle yatmāṃ:
(A 459 b3) /// yatmāṃ tāṣ säm cāturdi[ś]· /// ‘… <he> will be able. He … the four regions …’.3
The participle seems to be part of a future construction with the 3 Sg. Sbjv. form of ‘be’, but 
it cannot be unambiguously translated. It does not show any peculiarities either, in contrast with 
the past participle yāytu, which should be investigated separately.
Another notable feature of yāt- is the relatively frequent use of the gerundive II (at least nine 
entries), which usually expresses possibility [Krause, Thomas 1960: 186–187]. With negation, 
the gerundive can mean almost prohibition (A 2 a1–2, A 6 a3–4, A 7 a1–2), like ‘must not’. It is 
worth mentioning that A 6 a3–4 uses the copular verb, which is in the third person. Meanwhile, 
there are no examples of expression of the ﬁ rst or second person using either the ﬁ nite forms 
or the non-ﬁ nite forms with the copular verb. Along with the frequency of the gerundive, this 
suggests a strong tendency towards a generalized inactivity, both semantic and grammatical.
In addition, the following observation about predicative constructions containing yāt- shows 
a rather interesting yet controversial picture. Unfortunately, most of the examples are damaged 
to some degree, so there are few sentences that give full information. First, the scheme of grammat-
ical subject in the nominative (patient) + gerundive + inﬁ nitive with passive meaning is present:
(A 2 a1–2) : mā =pärmāt tsru yärm yātal ya(tsi) a2 tsraṣṣune : 1 ‘Not in the least must energy 
be decried. 1.’ [CEToM]
(A 6 a3–4) : mā (nu yā)a4talyi ṣeṣ lokit lo«ki»tāp-äk yärk yatsi wätkässi ‘Aber ein Gast würde 
nicht geheißen werden können einem Gaste aufzuwarten.’ [Sieg 1944: 9]
(A 7 a1–2) tämyo sās ñi ṣñaṣṣeyāp ṣñi lyutār pāk śkaṃ (lkā)a2tsi kräṃtso nasluneyā mā yātalyi 
tuṅ= śärsässi ‘Therefore, (because) she (is) of my own relative and mainly because 
 
2 Cf. [Peyrot 2013: 616]: “In subclauses, the subjunctive takes on a variety of functions, which may be 
summarised as ‘uncertainty’. It is used in the protasis of conditions, where it may be the only explicit 
marking of the conditional; it is further found in eventual, iterative, indeﬁ nite, comparative, conces-
sive, and ﬁ nal clauses. Compared to present subclauses, subjunctive subclauses denote events that are 
not well known or do not need to be known precisely, or of which it is uncertain whether they actually 
take place, or events that are irrelevant to the truth of the main clause.”
 
3 Hereinafter, translations are mine unless another source is stated. The * symbol after a word denotes 
a reconstructed form of an attested lexeme. The • and : symbols in the Tocharian citations denote spe-
ciﬁ c punctuation marks used in Tocharian manuscripts, while the = symbol denotes sandhi and the 
subscript marks show the beginning of a new line. The /// , – , and · symbols denote diﬀ erent amounts 
of the lost text. The symbols in my translations are: (…) — reconstructed text, that is not preserved 
in the manuscript;  — additional text, needed for understanding the phrase; […] — other additional 
notes; (?) — questionable translation.

of being beautiful to look at, (she) must not be made aware of the love’ (my transl., based 
on [CEToM]).
Another gerundive construction is no grammatical subject + agent in the genitive or per-
lative + gerundive + inﬁ nitive with active meaning:
(A 66 a5) (ā)kāl ritorā tatmus nasam ṣakk atsek nāñi brahmadatte wäl pats mäskal mā nu ñkā 
yātal mäccākye (///) ‘I was born because I cherished a wish. King Brahmadatta, by any 
means, must become my husband, for it is impossible for me (to kill the elephant) by my-
self’ (transl. by S. V. Malyshev, p. c., with my minor changes).
(A 69ext 4 b5) (yātal te nṣā mätta)kyāp puk saṃ[sā](r-ṣi)näs wrasaśśi klopaṃ [p]āṣlune yatsi 
kupre pat nu mā yātal • ‘(Is it possible for me to protect by myself) the living beings 
of Saṃsāra in <their> suﬀ ering? What if it is impossible?’ (reconstructed and transl. 
by I. B. Itkin and S. V. Malyshev, p. c., with my minor changes).
As for the personal forms, we can ﬁ nd the construction of grammatical subject in the nom-
inative (patient) + agent in the genitive or perlative + personal form + inﬁ nitive with pas-
sive meaning:
(A 14 a1–2) : (2 || śla)k śkaṃ pñintwāśśi säs pᵤkäṣ lyutār kāswone näm kuc ne täm mā a2 poryo 
tskäṃsaṃtär mā wäryo sikaṃtä(r) mā lāñcsā pärtsi yāteñc mā penu lyäksā kärnātsi yāteñc 
‘(2. And furthermore): Of virtue/merit this is the one quality superior to all for us: that it 
is not burned with ﬁ re, not ﬂ ooded away by water, [that it] cannot be taken away by kings 
[and that] further they cannot be stolen by thieves.’ 5 [CEToM]
(A 125ext 6 a3) … pāpṣu[ne] (waṣtäṣ laltuntāp pāssi ya)tatär mā waṣt lmontāp … ‘Observa-
tion <of rules> (by the one who left home) can be (observed), <but> not by a householder’ 
[Itkin 2020: 226] (reconstructed and transl. by S. V. Malyshev; conjecture (ya)tatär ac-
cording to [Siegling PK: 66]).
There are three possible exceptions within this system. The ﬁ rst contains the gerundive and 
the inﬁ nitive with active meaning, but the gerundive seems to play an attributive role:
(A 23 b1–3) pälkāt – b2 – – – – k·tukr(i) wl(e)ṣluneyā tsres päśres āsres tukrinuñcäs krośśes mā yāt-
lyes ptāñäb3(kte ka)pśñac tsinātsi ‘he saw (his hands) …, [which were,] due to working the 
clay, rough, hard, dry, covered in clay, cold and not ﬁ t to touch the Buddha’s body.’ [CEToM]
As for the unusual variant of rendering here, if we compare this usage with the proposed se-
mantics of yāt-, the sentence rather assumes that the hands could not touch the Buddha’s body 
because they were dirty, rough, etc. (external conditions again).
There is also a strange passage that seems to lack the inﬁ nitive:
(A 17 b2–3) pñintu(yo) b3 ptāñkät yärkā ypamāṃ yatatär : ‘through virtue one becomes the vene-
rated Buddha.’ [CEToM]
 
4 A 69ext = THT 1382.l + A 69 + THT 1382.c + THT 1868.
 
5 The translation is not fully correct, because pñintwāśśi and all the verbs in the subordinate clause are 
in the plural. However, it is diﬃ  cult to render this passage precisely, because it indeed shows some in-
consistency between the singular and the plural. Also, tskäṃsaṃtär and sikaṃtä(r) are in the pre sent, 
while yāteñc is in the subjunctive. [Peyrot 2013: 793] suggests that yāt- is sometimes used in the sub-
junctive in such contexts where it should be in the present. On the one hand, it can be another sign 
of the ‘unbalanced’ tense system. On the other, there can be an additional meaning, such as indeﬁ nite-
ness (see [Ibid.: 258–259]): ‘… taken away by whatever kings …’, ‘… stolen by whatever thieves …’. 
Such an emphasis on indeﬁ niteness can hardly be applied to the uncountable “ﬁ re” and “water”.
 
6 A 125ext = A 125 + THT 1425.e + A 117.
80 
Voprosy Jazykoznanija

The whole translation is questionable, and the assumption of meaning ‘become’ (or even ‘can 
become’) for yatatär, 3 Sg. Prs. M. of yāt-, has no apparent foundation. (If anything, the verb is 
intransitive.) Either the inﬁ nitive meaning ‘become’ is missing or the participle ypamāṃ is em-
ployed instead of the inﬁ nitive yatsi (perhaps by mistake). Also, this translation is built on the 
assumption that yärkā ypamāṃ ‘venerating /  venerated’ is the postpositive attribute of ptāñkät 
‘the Buddha’, which is a plausible story, but not a reliable one as Tocharian A has a strong ten-
dency to employ prepositive attributes. If we treat yärkā ypamāṃ as the argument of yatatär, 
the syntax of the phrase becomes a little bit less peculiar. In addition, taking into account that 
the next sentence advises the veneration of the Buddha, the whole passage may have quite the 
opposite meaning: ‘Through virtue the Buddha can [be] venerated.’
Finally, we can ﬁ nd a construction with an intransitive verb:
(YQ III.5 b2) /// (: w)[s](o)konyo ats śl= āñcālyi tṣaṃ ytsi yātaṣ eṅkäl kleś wikäṣṣ oki : ‘… with 
joy indeed and hands placed together he will be able to come here, [and] he will drive 
away as it were the impurity of passion’ [Ji et al. 1998: 165].
However, there are peculiarities in this passage and its translation, which can be connected 
with another interesting detail about the usage of yāt-. While yātaṣ is the subjunctive form, wikäṣ 
‘drives away, removes’ is the present-tense form. Still, [Ji et al. 1998] translate both verbs us-
ing the future tense. Such interpretation is possible as the present sometimes can have a future 
meaning. On the contrary, this passage has been treated as an example of a present- subjunctive: 
“Morphologically, TA yātaṣ looks like a subjunctive, but in this example parallel and unambig-
uously presentic wikäṣ suggests that it is used as a present” [Peyrot 2013: 653–654]. Rather un-
usually, both variants assume the use of two diﬀ erent tenses with the same meaning within the 
same sentence. There is an equal chance that it is a conditional clause (subjunctive) plus a main 
clause (present): the conditional conjunction kᵤpre ne may have been lost because of the destruc-
tion of the leaf, yet it can be just omitted, especially in poetical texts (e.g. A 65 a2, A 229 a7, 
A 230 a2). Note that the YQ III.5 b2 passage is also written in verse. It is likely that only an analy-
sis of the context where the passage is from, as well as making a comparison with the parallel 
found in Old Uyghur, can give us a solution.
The plots of the Tocharian A (TA) and Old Uyghur (OU) fragments coincide along general 
lines: a group of women go to the Nyagrodhārāma monastery, the dwelling of the Buddha, and 
recite diﬀ erent speeches. One of them sees the monastery and speaks in monologue about how 
the Buddha brought happiness to thousands of women and cured them of their passion. After 
that, queen Gautamī steps into the monastery. Despite the fact that the OU version is much bet-
ter preserved, it does not contain the name of the last speaker. In [Geng, Klimkeit 1988: 191], 
it is restored as Gautamī, but the Tocharian version has the name of a diﬀ erent queen: Gopikā. 
In addition, the OU monologue has nothing similar to ‘with joy indeed and hands placed to-
gether he will be able to come here’ (the Buddha is already in Nyagrodhārāma and does not go 
anywhere). Keeping in mind that YQ III.5 b2 contains no explicit pronouns or words that could 
tell the gender, I suggest that at least one ‘she’ should replace a ‘he’ in this sentence. While, ac-
cording to the OU parallel, it is the Buddha who provides the cure from passions, he is not the 
subject of the subjunctive part of the sentence.
Summing up, the Tocharian pada probably means ‘if <she = Gautamī> can come here [to the 
monastery] with joy indeed and hands placed together, <he = the Buddha> will drive away <from 
her> as it were the impurity of passion.’ The sentence preserves the active construction, but it 
stresses rather the external condition than the inner capability.
Whether yāt- can form active constructions or not, it obviously has a very strong tendency 
towards passive and reﬂ exive ones. Strikingly, cämp- provides us with plenty of active exam-
ples and with a complete absence of passive ones. In other words, the agent of cämp- can only 
be the subject (or at least tends to be so), while yāt- gives to its agent the object role, creating 
an impersonal impression for this lexeme. The subject of both the ﬁ nite forms of cämp- and its 
gerundive constructions tends to be always in the nominative.

Apart from this, investigating cämp- without comparing it to yāt- cannot give us so much in-
formation. Cämp- is visibly more frequent than its counterpart because there are at least 50 re-
gistered examples accounting for it. However, cämp- shows a much more consistent situation, 
deﬁ nitely corresponding to the aforementioned variants of its translation, provides a diverse va-
riety of tense forms, and is attested in all three persons:
1 Sg. Prs.: (A 191 b3) /// (eṃ)tsässi mā śkaṃ cäm[pa]m || ‘… and I cannot take’
2 Sg. Prs.:  (A 343 b4) /// (o)mäskeṃ wraso[m] (mā tu) [cä]mpät ‘… as a bad person you [Sg.] 
are not able <to do something> …’ (transl. from [CEToM], with my minor changes).
3 Pl. Prt.:  (A 395 b1) • tmäṣ āsuk ysi kuc yärmaṃ mā campär ‘Then they could not come fur-
ther away at all’ [CEToM]
The gerundive cämpäl demonstrates no semantic diﬀ erence from the ﬁ nite forms and is quite 
regularly used with the ﬁ rst and second person forms of the verb nas- ‘be’ (all these examples 
are in the present). Even in the cases where the copula is omitted, A 342 a5 and b2–3, the ﬁ rst 
person is explicitly shown by the pronouns.
Little can be added to the traditional variants of rendering. Sometimes the very contexts sug-
gest ‘manage’ as a translation, emphasizing the personal potency not only to conduct some ac-
tion, but to overcome something. For example:
(A 7 a2–3) kus nu cämpiṣ taṃne kräṃ(tso)a3nāṃ taṃne tkanā «†taṃne» «†tkanā» taṃne praṣtā 
kälporäṣ āñcäm sākässi ‘But who would, having found such a beautiful girl in such a place 
and at such a time, be able to restrain oneself?’ [CEToM]
(A 153 b2) /// neyā āsäñcac porr oki eṅkäl santānaṃ täklā-ṃ kapśañi sākässi mā śkaṃ campäs 
ṣūraṃ lcā-ṃ /// ‘… because of (touching?) the buttocks (?), like a ﬁ re, the passion lit 
up in his mindstream, and <he> did not manage to restrain the body, the seed came out 
from him …’ (transl. by S. V. Malyshev and me).
(A 313 a5–6) cämpäl te nasam ānand śtwarāk päñ pi puklākaṃ salu (puttiśpa)a6rṣṣāṃ wles 
wlessi : ‘Am I able, oh Ānanda, in 45 years’ time, to fulﬁ ll the entire service of a Bud-
dha?’ [CEToM]
Basically, cämp- is ‘be able / managed / will manage to do something’, whereas yāt- is ‘It is 
possible to do something’.7
Finally, the Old Uyghur parallels should be mentioned. They are surprisingly scarce, as most 
of the respective OU fragments either are damaged or diﬀ er from the TA passages. Perhaps the 
only interesting example can be found here:
TA (A 296 a6) (///) (kupre ne … täm) kärsoräṣ rinäṣtār was yātiś-śi [ā](kāl … knässi) /// ‘(Si,) 
après avoir compris (cela), tu nous abandonnes, puisse le vœu (désiré) être en état (d’être 
réalisé) par toi !’ (conjecture and translation according to [Pinault 1993: 139]).
OU (MaitrHami 13, 8 b10–12) amtï inčä ök ävrilmätin barïr b11 ärsär siz … küsämiš küsüšüngüz 
qanmaqï b12 bolzun … ‘Wenn Ihr jetzt genau so, ohne Euch umzuwenden, weggeht, so möge 
Euer ersehnter Wunsch in Erfüllung gehen!’ [Geng et al. 1991: 290].
These passages do not correspond precisely, and while the TA sentence has the optative form 
of yāt- (‘may it be possible’), the OU fragment has bolzun, the voluntative form of the verb bol- 
‘be’ (‘may it be’). Furthermore, the TA passage YQ II.13 b7 contains cämp-. Its OU parallel, 
MaitrHami 2, 15 b18–19, probably contains a construction with the verb bol-, but it is too da-
maged to reach any deﬁ nitive conclusion.
 
7 Cf. also [Seržant 2014: 201–204], where we can ﬁ nd a similar view on the deontic nature of the Grund-
verb of yāt-. Note, however, that, because Seržant proposes a new interpretation of the Tocharian ver-
bal system, he treats this not as the Grundverb, but as “Inagentiv”. The basic paradigm is diﬀ erent and 
expresses not the deontic, but the dynamic possibility (see also footnote 10).

2. The adjectives cämpamo and cämpam*
Turning to cämp-, the related adjectives cämpam* and cämpamo should also be mentioned. 
Cämpamo is borrowed from Tocharian B (TB) [Winter 1961: 272–273], with the same meaning 
as the verbal forms, and always used as the predicate (with or without a copula). Seven of nine 
passages containing this word are found in verse (A 56 a1, A 71 b1, A 125+117 b3–4, A 166 a5, 
A 212 a7, A 275 b7, YQ I.10 a7), but the style of the remaining two (A 368 b2 and b3) cannot 
be identiﬁ ed with certainty. Tocharian poetry is syllabic and uses diﬀ erent instruments to reduce 
or increase the number of syllables in accordance with the requirements of the meter:
(A 71 b1) : lāñciṃ watku yatr appärmāt rake träṅktsi mā tswātär cämpamo pe ñi se säs : ‘De-
liberately, however, this my son mocks the royal command [and] does not comply to say 
a single word, although [he is] able [to speak].’ [CEToM]
The required number of syllables in the line is 22, which is divided in three groups: of 8 
(lāñciṃ watku yatr appärmāt), 7 (rake träṅktsi mā tswātär), and 7 (cämpamo pe ñi se säs) syl-
lables. The 3 Sg. Prs. form cämpäṣ is too short and does not ﬁ t here. Therefore, it is quite likely 
that cämpamo is used only as a poetic counterpart of the ﬁ nite forms of cämp- and it was the 
main reason for its borrowing, as it does not represent any additional meaning or connotation. 
Strangely, the loanword in TA appears to be even more frequent than its source in TB. (Regarding 
this, there are only six reliable examples: PK AS 6B a2, PK NS 22 a4, THT 214 a3, THT 295 b6, 
THT 1109 b1, and THT 1374.g a2).
Moreover, as [Winter 1961: 272] states, TA probably has its own adjective counterpart 
cämpam*, which coincides with the 1 Sg. Prs. form of the verb and tends to be extremely rare. 
This lexeme is found in two questionable passages:
(THT 1592.a, a2) /// s[si] mā cämpam-ci waṣtā pic /// ‘… I cannot <do something> to you. 
Go home!’
Given the enclitic pronoun -ci, we can state with some certainty that the verb is attested here. 
The second example is the aforementioned A 191 b3 8, but [Malzahn 2010: 635] argues that it 
also contains the verbal form. The same interpretation is provided in [Carling et al. 2009: 195]. 
Indeed, this passage is from prose, and for this genre, the presence of the adjective in ﬁ nal po-
sition (especially without any copula), instead of a verb, is very unlikely. However, the occur-
rence of the Nom. Pl. f. form cämpaminā[ñ] (A 388 b2), pace [Carling et al. 2009: 195], can-
not be a form of cämpamo 9, then it clearly indicates the existence of the TA adjective cämpam* 
(I. B. Itkin, p. c.). Unfortunately, such scarce evidence does not permit a reliable analysis.
3. The Antigrundverb of yāt-,
past participle yāytu and adjective sākär
The Antigrundverb paradigm of yāt- encodes two meanings. The direct one is clearly the 
causative ‘enable’ (in other words, ‘make something possible /  probable’, which corresponds 
neatly with the proposed Grundverb sense). On the other hand, its ﬁ gurative meaning is rather 
 
8 (/// (eṃ)tsässi mā śkaṃ cäm[pa]m || ‘… and I cannot take’)
 
9 Cf., for instance, the declension of another TB-to-TA borrowing, pruccamo ‘useful, advantageous; ex-
cellent’, that attests the Nom./Acc. Pl. f. form, which is pruccamont (A 14 b6), not **pruccamināñ / 
**pruccaminās. On the other hand, as one of the anonymous reviewers noted, TA cämpam* is not a regu-
lar formation, and the ‘native’ TA word should be *cämpäm. However, TA adjectives sometimes demon-
strate such irregularities, cf. kulypam ‘desiring’ instead of the expected *kulypām (I. B. Itkin, p. c.).

unusual: ‘to tame’ [Malzahn 2010: 787], ‘mansuefacere’ [Poucha 1955: 239]. All in all, the pub-
lished translations agree about this meaning, and I cannot ﬁ nd any grounds for questioning them.10
Still, there is no consensus about the past participle yāytu (and the CEToM seemingly does 
not have translations at all for this form). There are only ﬁ ve examples (A 147 b3, A 308 b6, 
A 322 b6, A 464 b3, and THT 2056 a2). Fortunately, one of these passages belongs to a Sanskrit- 
Tocharian A bilingual text:
(A 464 b3) || bhadraka • yāytu ||
Sanskrit bhadraka is deﬁ ned by a variety of words with positive connotations: ‘good, brave, 
ﬁ ne, handsome, beautiful’ [Monier-Williams] (see also [Mayrhofer 1996: 244]). It could be pos-
sible to be satisﬁ ed with this vague meaning, because it suits to all the fragments unsurprisingly 
well. However, a more thorough investigation can bring new details to light. See the only pas-
sage with suﬃ  cient context:
(A 147 b3) … klaṅkäṣ kākärpu yāytu ākälṣäll oki śla ynāñmune śino ymāṃ riṣa(knac) k(ā)ts(e) 
yeṣ
This can be translated as ‘… coming down from the draught animal, like a yāytu disciple, 
going with respect … <he> came to the sage’, where śino is a hapax legomenon. As for the re-
maining passages, the following are more or less informative:
(A 322 b6) /// śolaṃ yāytuñc(ä)s wrassaśśäl /// ‘… in life with yāytu creatures …’
(THT 2056 a2) /// [yā]ytu sā[kär] /// (reading by I. B. Itkin, p. c.; pace [Carling et al. 2009: 37])
The collocation with sākär is interesting because its derivative is used for the translation of the 
same Sanskrit root in another bilingual fragment:
(A 386 b1) cittabhadravatā • pälskes sākrone :
[Thomas, Krause 1964: 153] translates sākär as ‘glückselig’ (and sākrone as ‘Glückseligkeit’), 
while [Poucha 1955: 362] oﬀ ers the variant ‘prosper, felix’. Again, there is a positive connota-
tion, but the word does not seem to be well deﬁ ned. As for textual evidence, a few examples are 
found, providing some context:
(A 93 a5) : sākkres parnoñcäśśi kāpñe yāmu saṃkrām nyagrodha (///) ‘Being loved by the sākär 
[Acc. Pl.] ones and the glorious ones, … the Nyagrodhā(rāma) <monastery> …’
(A 239 a3) mroskᵤluneyo sākrone : ‘… by disgust to the world sākrone …’
However, the word order suggests another word division and, thus, translation:
(A 239 a3) mroskᵤlune yo sākrone ‘… disgust to the world and sākrone …’ (I. B. Itkin, p. c.)
(A 266 b8) yetuñcäs sākres klaṅksā lmo(räṣ) /// ‘… sitting on docile riding animals’ (transl. from 
CEToM based on [Carling 2000: 237]; emphasis mine).
Carling [Ibid.] provides the OU parallel, where we can ﬁ nd the word yawas (cf. javaš in [Na-
deljaev et al. 1969: 248] ‘gentle, meek, tamed, domestic’).
 10 Yet (continuing somewhat from the preceding footnote), [Seržant 2014: 201–204] splits the Antigrund-
verb into two paradigms: the basic one (‘control’) and the causative (‘enable, tame’). The former, how-
ever, is attested in only two examples: YQ II.15 b6 and YQ III.12 b3 (coincidently, with the subjunctive 
and gerundive, derived from the subjunctive stem, respectively). Both passages lack important parts 
that could allow one to determine the nuances of meaning, while the Old Uyghur parallels are no help 
in verifying them with certainty. And even if these translations are correct, the opposition between ‘con-
trol’ and ‘tame’ seems rather forced to me, as we can imagine some core meaning (e.g. ‘subdue’).

(YQ III.9 a2) /// [ne]yo sākroneyo kläṣmuneyo kaknu ‘having materialized by …, blissfulness 
[and] patience’ [Ji et al. 1998: 183].
The parallel OU passage, MaitrHami 3, 8 b24, does not contain this part, but, quite notably, 
tells about the life of a monastic community (see [Geng, Klimkeit 1988: 203]).
[Poucha 1955: 362] adds to this A 129 b2 as well, but it is very damaged and [Siegling PK: 
70] oﬀ ers a diﬀ erent reading excluding sākär, so it probably does not belong here. Another 
example mentioned by Poucha, A 314 b1, also lacks the crucial part needed to deﬁ ne whether 
there is sākär or another word.
Summarizing the translation of sākär (A 266 b8) and its probable synonymity with yāytu, 
I would suggest that both sākär and yāytu mean ‘obedient, docile’. In this view, it is worth men-
tioning that these two lexemes frequently occur in passages about animals or monks, for whom 
obedience is an expected feature.
It would be tempting to link yāytu grammatically with the Antigrundverb paradigm, as both 
stems are identical, but the past participle of yāt- (Antigrundverb) has been attested in (A 425e + 
A 425f a4) as (yāyä)tṣuräṣ [Peyrot 2016: 202]. However, the existence of such a meaning in the 
paradigms of the verb could somehow aﬀ ect the semantic shift in the case of the Grundverb 
past participle.11
Reanalyzing the examples following this view, I daresay that it ﬁ ts much better in most cases:
(A 93 a5) ‘Being loved by the obedient ones and the glorious ones, … the Nyagrodhā(rāma) 
<monastery> …’
(A 147 b3–4) ‘… coming down from the draught animal, like an obedient disciple, going with 
respect … <he> came to the sage’
(A 313 a2–3) ‘just so through the marvel of sunrise all beings had grown gentle and docile then’
(A 369 a3) ‘docile, beautiful, … [adjective?] animal’
(A 386 b1) ‘cittabhadravatā — obedience of mind’
(YQ III.9 a2) ‘having materialized by …, obedience [and] patience’
The material of TB can hardly help there, as [Adams 2013: 744] notes in the article about TB 
sākre*: “The meaning is based on the almost certain correspondence with TchA sākär.” How-
ever, one of the examples there is particularly notable, as Adams himself expresses uncertainty 
about the syntax of the phrase:
(IOL Toch 51 a4) /// ·[o] wiksen-ne sakreñ arṣā(klaṃ) ///
 11 One of the anonymous reviewers suggested the opposite scenario. Namely, sometimes the peculiari-
ties of the semantics of yāt- and its derivatives (see also the analysis of yātlune below) can represent 
not the innovations but the traces of older meaning(s). However, at the ﬁ rst glance, there are no ap-
parent clues. [Adams 2013: 528] links this verb with the PIE root *yet-, ‘strive, ﬂ y at, concern oneself 
zealously’. Adams also mentions a hypothesis by Van Windekens [1976: 645] that the Tocharian root 
was borrowed from the Sanskrit past participle yata- from yam- ‘hold, sustain, tame, etc.’. While this 
scheme does not seem plausible, the semantics of the paronymic Sanskrit word could aﬀ ect the Toch-
arian translation (see also the next footnote).
 
 Maksim V. Vyzhlakov 
85
Apart from the analyzed adjective which is probably in Nom. Pl. m., there is the verb wiksen 
‘<they> avoid’ plus 3 Sg. enclitic pronoun -ne, and also the noun arṣā(klaṃ) ‘snakes’. Adams 
suggests that sakreñ can be the grammatical subject of wiksen. This interpretation assumes an in-
verted word order (which can occur in a poetic line, but there is no certainty about the genre 
in this case). On the other hand, if we treat sakreñ as the attribute of arṣā(klaṃ), there is a word 
collocation ‘good snakes’ (if one follows the traditional translation of TB sākre / TA sākär), 
which is quite unusual, because snakes can hardly be good. However, as I. B. Itkin (p.c.) pro-
poses, wiksen-ne marks the end of the previous phrase, whereas the last two words are the sub-
ject of the next sentence and should be reconstructed as sakreñ arṣā(klañ). Adding to this the 
newly proposed meaning for the lexeme, one can get a less unusual, both from the syntactical 
and semantical point of view, interpretation of the passage, which allows to translate it as fol-
lowing: ‘… avoid him. The tamed snakes …’.
All in all, this transition — from the general ‘good’ to the speciﬁ c ‘obedient’ — is not odd. 
Obedience and timidity were obvious virtues for the Buddhist doctrine, especially in the world 
of monasteries, teachers and students.
Finally, this obscure passage should be mentioned:
(A 138 b1) /// || āytātsuney· ///
Having in mind the existence of the TB privative ayātaitstse*, which likely means ‘untam-
able, indomitable, unsubdued’ [Adams 2013: 22], this word may be an abstract noun derived 
from the hypothetical TA privative āytāts* (S. V. Malyshev, p. c.). While there is no suﬃ  cient 
context to specify its semantics, it would be tempting to have it connected with yāt-.
4. The verbal abstracts cämplune and yātlune
Usually, the verbal abstracts are not given much attention. [Thomas, Krause 1964: 101, 128; 
Malzahn 2010: 635, 787] simply list both words as derivatives without any commentary. For 
cämplune, [Poucha 1955: 103] gives ‘facultas’; [Carling et al. 2009: 195], ‘ability’. For yātlune, 
[Poucha 1955: 239] equates it with Sanskrit ṛddhi ‘facultas, sollertia’. A search on the CEToM 
adds translations that do not widen the meaning considerably: ‘capability’ or ‘capacity’. While 
in general this can hardly be questioned, a heedful analysis shows a more controversial picture.
The main distinction between these words tends to lie in the concept of inherence. This 
can be illustrated by the verbs with which these nouns collocate, especially in the patient role. 
Namely, cämplune attests only two such tokens: one can ‘understand, seize’ it (A 43+52 b6), but 
it can also be ‘seen’ (A 397 b1). As for yātlune, one can ‘seize’ (A 54 b6) and ‘see’ (A 324 a7) it 
as well, but one can also ‘attain’, ‘reach’, or ‘gain’ it (A 1 a2, A 16 a1–2, A 271 a5, YQ N.4 a7, 
YQ N.4 a8). Moreover, yātlune can ‘appear’ (A 372 a2), ‘increase’ (A 254 a6–7), and probably 
‘disappear’ (A 243 b4). With it, a subject can be ‘endowed’, ‘provided’, or ‘furnished’ (A 317 a3, 
A 345 b1–2, YQ V.1 a2). In other words, yātlune is quite regularly described as something that 
can be given or attained, something that is not inherent to its owner. By contrast, there is no such 
nuance for cämplune and it can be probably characterized as an inherent ability. Indeed, the 
richness of the data should also be noted: cämplune is rarer than its counterpart (around 22 as op-
posed to 38 examples; the situation is the absolute opposite to that of the corresponding verbal 
forms). However, there is a striking correspondence to the semantics of their respective verbs: 
the ‘external possibility’ of yāt- and the ‘inner capability’ of cämp-.
Here are some additional details strengthening this interpretation. For instance, cämplune has 
no proven examples of plural forms. It can be treated like something indivisible, quite natural 
for inner potency. The only possible exception is the form (c)ä(mpluneytu) /// (A 292 b3), recon-
structed in [Pinault 1999: 221]. However, G.-J. Pinault himself calls this reading “purement con-
jecturale” based on ‘the ten powers’ (or ‘abilities’) of the Buddha in the parallel OU text [Ibid.: 
86 
Voprosy Jazykoznanija 
2020. № 5
222]. But, as I. B. Itkin (p.c.) notes, in TA, the respective sense is always denoted by śäk tampeyntu 
(cf., for example, A 372 a3), so it is more likely that we should restore (ś)ä(k tampeyntu) in this line.
The overwhelming majority of the examples can be divided into two groups. The ﬁ rst de-
scribes abilities in a literal sense, and they are always characterized by constructions like ‘cäm-
plune to do something’ or some wider context (A 4 b5, A 11 b4, A 29 b2, a number of passages 
from the A 384–386 manuscript). The second group usually has no such explanations but is used 
as ‘cämplune of the Buddha’ (A 43+52 b6, A 153 b3, A 438 a3) or at least with adjectives like 
‘great’, ‘big’, or ‘mighty’ (A 397 b1, A 438 b6, THT 2152 b1). This group deals with the con-
cept of ‘power’ (perhaps occasionally even in a supernatural sense), but, again, there is no clue 
that this power was acquired.
In this context, it would be interesting to look at A 4 b5: tämnek {t}ṣaṃ ākntsuneyis 
cämpluneyā wrasañ ‘Just so are the beings because of their ignorance’ [CEToM], literally 
‘… because of their ability for ignorance’, and, if we apply to my reasoning, this ignorance is 
inherent for the living beings.
As for yātlune, it demonstrates more fractured and even obscure semantics, just like its respec-
tive verb.12 Strangely, whereas ‘ability’ should be deduced from the source verb, there are almost 
no passages that conclusively show this. To be precise, only one example is found in this regard:
(YQ N.4 a8) /// [a]käṃtsuneṣiṃ spārtwluneṣiṃ yātlune śkaṃ śtärcäṃ yomu ‘… and having 
gained the fourth ability, connected with transformation of riches’
Based on this translation, we can suggest the same meaning in the preceding line:
(YQ N.4 a7) /// ñ mäskaṃtär yātluneytu śtwar yomuṣ : ‘… <they> become the ones who have 
gained the four abilities’
Of course, in practice, ‘ability’ can be used without any speciﬁ cations, but the distinction 
from cämplune is notable. YQ N.4 a7 also demonstrates other diﬀ erences: the use of the plural 
and collocation with numerals. For the latter, see also the following example.
(A 317 a3) tosäṃ tri yātluneyntuyo pukyo kaknu ṣeṣ /// ‘… <he?> was wholly provided with 
these three abilities …’
As for the plural of this noun, though, it is not always ‘abilities’, but instead a diﬀ erent, un-
expected meaning is possible, as these examples show:
(A 254 a2–4) /// (tāk) k(e)tuma(ti) [r](i) waṣtu ṣontañ wrasañ wrasaśśi yātluneyntu • [mä](nt ne 
tṣaṃ riñ waṣtu) a3 (ṣontañ wrasañ wrasaśśi) yātluneyntu mäskanträ • tämnek ālkontäk

yāmäs •) ‘(This was) the city Ketumatī, houses, streets, beings, and the achievements of the 
beings. So as (here there are cities, houses, streets, beings, and) the achievements (of the 
beings), just so the venerable Maitreya, the Buddha-god, (by his supernatural power let 
appear) other cities, houses, streets, beings, and achievements of the beings.’ [CEToM]
(254 b1–2) ñemiṣināñ riñ ñemiṣin(āñ) b2 (waṣtu ñemiṣiñi ṣontañ) ś[l]a niṣpal yātluneyaśśäl

(the jewel-streets), with [all] possessions and achievements shrouded in ﬂ ames, burn one 
and all as in the Raurava-hell.’ [CEToM]
Cf. also examples in the singular:
(A 271 a6) /// (yā)tl(u)neyo mā trikal : 2 ‘… one must not be misled because of property’ (con-
jecture and transl. according to I. B. Itkin, p. c.)
 12 As S. V. Malyshev (p.c.) suggests, the range of meanings of TA yātlune mostly corresponds to that 
of Sanskrit ṛddhi ‘increase, growth, prosperity, success, good fortune, wealth, abundance, accomplish-
ment, perfection, supernatural power’ [Monier-Williams]. This hypothesis requires further veriﬁ cation.

teacher speaks: “I said: their household property (?), food indeed” ’
The translation of A 254 a2–4 and b1–2 is based on [Geng et al. 2004: 54–55], where the 
variant ‘die Leistungen’ is given. It is hard to say what the reasons are for such a translation. 
Unfortunately, there is no parallel in the OU texts for it [Ibid.: 51]. Such a collocation is quite 
homogenous: streets, houses, property — in other words, physical objects that lay in the se-
mantic ﬁ eld of wealth and possessions. A similar, but not-so-verbose collocation can be seen 
in the last two fragments too. In one of them, A 304 b2, yātlune seems to be translated by the 
OU hendiadys ärk türk ‘Macht und Kraft’ [Geng et al. 1991: 292] in MaitrHami 13, 9 b24–25. 
But these fragments, though very similar, do not correspond with one another perfectly, and 
the OU passage mentions nothing pertaining to property or household: ‘Ich habe mein Haus, 
meinen Sohn, meine Frau, meine Mutter, meinen Vater, meine Verwandten, Macht und Kraft, 
Glanz und Gloria, Freuden und Heroismus vollständig aufgegeben’ [Ibid.: 291–292]. There-
fore, yātlune cannot be argued conclusively to be ‘power’ here. With all of this in mind, for 
yātlune in general and for these passages in particular, I would like to proﬀ er a novel gloss: 
‘possessions, property’.
Still, the overwhelming majority of the other fragments containing the singular form and 
with a suﬃ  cient context can be rendered by ‘power’ or ‘might’ (including other passages with 
‘achievement(s)’). It is here that we ﬁ nd the obvious contamination of yātlune with cämplune, 
but yātlune, as mentioned earlier, stresses ‘power that is not inherent to the owner and can be 
gained’ (from this point of view, the transition to ‘possessions, property’ is quite natural as it is 
obviously a ‘gainable’ thing). The understanding of yāt- as ‘something is possible (for me)’ also 
provides an explanation of yātlune in the sense, on the one hand, of ‘ability as a new possibility’ 
and, on the other hand, of ‘power as an increase in possibilities’. For this, see also the Russian 
idiom čelovek s bol’šimi vozmožnostjami, literally ‘person with great possibilities’ = ‘powerful, 
rich person’. If so, then, for example, the passage below can be understood as ‘… great [inner] 
power and [achieved] might …’:
(A 438 b6) /// tsopatsäṃ cämplune yā(t)l(u) /// (conjecture according to [Siegling PK: 438])
Of course, we cannot state for sure that the distinction between cämplune and yātlune was 
‘alive’. It could be just two diﬀ erent (and almost opposite) ways to develop the same (or at least 
similar) meaning. However, the verb collocation and the presence /  absence of ability speciﬁ -
cations are divided in a rather patent fashion. Still, sometimes these words overlap with each 
other, because there are two fragments where yātlune is linked with the Buddha, whose power 
can hardly be anything other than inherent:
(A 32 a5–6) /// (yā)a6tluneyo ptāñkät käṣṣ(i) op[y]ā(c) /// ‘… through his capacity the Buddhalord, 
the teacher remembered (his previous births)’ [CEToM].
(A 357 3) /// (pru)[c]camñeṣi wākmats ptāñkäkteṃ yātlune n-äṃ ‘… he has … excellent, out-
standing, inherent to the Buddha power’.
In A 357 3, however, it is unclear whether the main subject of these epithets is the Buddha 
himself.
Finally, there is a rare but remarkable variant as ‘perfection(s)’:
(A 3 b6 — 4 a1) : yomnāṣ lame ñä(ktaśśi)a1 yātluneyo sne nākäm : ‘…it attains the dwelling 
of the gods through its ﬂ awless perfection’ [CEToM]. Note, however, that [Lane 1947: 
39] has ‘prospering’ and [Pinault 2008: 241] even interprets the literal ‘capacité’ as ‘vertu’.

pñintu ke ne kulypal yātlune : ‘…they do not reach the perfection that virtue achieved 
without eﬀ ort. Therefore, he who longs for perfection shall always gather merit’ [CEToM].
I hold no objections to such a variant except for a general point, that we should strive for 
as few translations as possible, especially if there is no consensus in at least some cases. It is also 
strange that this variant is applied only to a speciﬁ c manuscript. Moreover, A 14 b4 just lacks the 
essential context to make a conclusion, giving us room to render yātlune as ‘po wers’ (remem-
ber also the Buddha’s ten powers mentioned in the section on cämplune). On the other hand, 
the very transition from ‘power’ to ‘perfection’, especially in the case of ‘Buddha- connected 
power’, is quite plausible. In addition, ‘perfection’ seems well suited for the other three pas-
sages (A 15 b2 in particular).
As for the Old Uyghur parallels, there are at least two counterparts of cämplune: küč ‘strength, 
power’ (TA YQ III.8 b7 — OU MaitrHami 3, 8 b9) and the hendiadys küč küsün (TA YQ I.8 b3 — 
OU MaitrHami 1, 14 b17) with the same meaning [Nadeljaev et al. 1969: 322–323] (notably 
enough, [Geng, Klimkeit 1988: 103] translate it as ‘Kraft und Vermögen’). For yātlune, besides 
the aforementioned A 304 b2 13, there is no apparent correspondence.
5. Conclusion
The main diﬀ erence between yāt- and cämp- and their derived verbal abstracts lies in the dis-
tinction between the external and internal conditions. Whereas cämp- emphasizes potency (‘to be 
able’, ‘to manage’), yāt- emphasizes probability (‘may’, ‘to be possible for someone’). Some 
word forms of yāt- have a tendency to lexicalization. Its gerundive yātal in negation can even 
depict prohibition (‘impossible’ or ‘must not’). Besides, its past participle yāytu seems to mean 
‘obedient, docile’. The other TA word, sākär, used for the translation of the same Sanskrit root, 
bhadra-, probably has a similar meaning. The Antigrundverb paradigm of yāt- has two mean-
ings: the literally causative one (‘enable, make possible’) and the idiomatized one (‘to tame’).
Highly synonymous, cämplune and yātlune share both literal (‘ability’) and ﬁ gurative (‘power, 
might’) meanings. The nuance is that yātlune considerably stresses non-inherence: it is regularly 
described as something that can be gained. By contrast, cämplune has no such nuance and is 
likely to focus on the inherent, indivisible potency of ‘being able’. Apart from this, yātlune has
